<p class="center"><i>Which shows Some of the Gods in their Machinery, with but a
Shadowy Hint of the Printer&#8217;s Devil</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Amidst</span> the untidy litter of torn paper that strewed the bare plank
floor there stood a large double writing-table, spread with proofs and
manuscript and pamphlets; and, with his feet in the litter of the floor
and his elbows in the litter of the table, sat a gaunt yellow-haired
youth, solemnly writing.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme peered at his work in the waning light of the
departing November afternoon; and the deepening dusk that took
possession of the shabby room, turning all things to the colour of
shadows, strained his attention, drawing long lines about his mouth
and pronouncing the pallor of his serious face&mdash;the grim mask of the
humorist. The slips of paper that were set into the sleeve-ends of his
well-brushed threadbare coat to save the soiling of his shirt-cuffs,
and the long reach of yellow sock that showed his feet thrust a
wrinkled span beyond the original intention of his much-knee&#8217;d
trousers, marked the ordered untidiness of the literary habit.</p>

<p>Everything in the room&mdash;the overflowed waste-paper basket at his
feet; the severe academic comfort of the polished wooden armchair
that stood yawning augustly vacant opposite to him; the shut door at
his right hand, with its curt announcement of &#8220;Editor&#8221; in stiff, forbidding
letters; the low bookshelves about the room with their rows
of books of reference, stacks of journals and literary scraps piled a-top
of them; the walls with their irregular array of calendars, advertisements,
notices, and printed and pictured odds and ends; the atmosphere
of the scrap-gathering paste-pot and of clippings from the
knowledge of the world; the sepulchral, monotonous clock that ticked
its aggressive statement of the passage of time as though with a cough
of admonition that, whatever journalism might be, life was short and
art was long; the naked mantel beneath it, which held the shabby soul
of the jerrybuilder turned to stone&mdash;for it is the hearth that is haunted
by the spirit of the architect, and this one had been a vulgar fellow&mdash;the
bare fireplace that did not even go through the feeble pretence of
giving comfort, for it had no fender, no hearthrug, but gaped, bored
and empty and black, upon the making of literature&mdash;everything
marked the room to be one of those scanty workshops where opinions
are made, the dingy editorial office of a struggling weekly review;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the extent of the dinginess showed it to be a very struggling affair
indeed.</p>

<p>The young man blotted his writing, and flipped through some pages
of manuscript:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliver,&#8221; said he, without looking up, &#8220;a light, I think!... We
have here lying before us a most caustic literary criticism; but the light
is so far gone that we can scarce see the dogmatic gentleman&#8217;s own
literary infelicities&mdash;nay, can scarce see even his most split infinitives.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke like a leading article, with a slight cockney accent.</p>

<p>In the gloom of a dark corner by the window, at a high desk that
stood against the wall, where he sat perched on a tall office stool with
his feet curled round its long legs, a small boy ceased reading, and,
fumbling about in the breast-pocket of his short Eton jacket, lugged
out a tin box, struck a match, and, leaning forward, set a flame to the
gas-jet. The place leaped into light. The youngster flung the matchbox
across the room, and went on with his reading. It fell at the feet
of the yellow-haired youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll,&#8221; said he, stooping over and searching for it amongst the
torn fragments of paper, &#8220;like those of even greater genius, our aims
are only too often lost in the sea of wasted endeavour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found the box; lit the gas at his right hand; coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you putting that down?&#8221; he asked drily of the grim unanswering
silence.</p>

<p>The boy took no notice. The yellow-haired youth chuckled, and the
deep-furrowed lines about his mouth broadened into a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>The boy Oliver could scarcely have been fourteen years of age, and
had he not been son of the editor, and that editor the thriftless owner
of but a very broken-winged Muse, and of a steadily diminishing
literary property, the boy must still have been at school. He sighed
heavily, rousing from his reading:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Netherby,&#8221; said he, &#8220;here&#8217;s a poem by that fellow with the
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out the manuscript.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme looked up:</p>

<p>&#8220;A lyric?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Drivel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme sighed, and sat back in his chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;With what candid brutality the sub-editorial mind treats the most
ecstatic flights of the imagination!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The boy Oliver shifted impatiently on his high stool:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I reject the ponderous rot?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We</i>&mdash;if you please, Oliver&mdash;<i>we</i>. It is always better to adopt the
editorial <i>we</i> in matters of weight; and it throws the responsibility
upon the irresponsible gods of journalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll sighed, stretched himself, and yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ll reject it, eh?... No good troubling the
governor&#8221;&mdash;he jerked his thumb towards the editor&#8217;s room&mdash;&#8220;he&#8217;s so
beastly short this afternoon. But I had better <i>write</i> the rejection, I
suppose&mdash;the father doesn&#8217;t like poets to be rejected on the printed
form&mdash;they&#8217;re so sensitive.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>He settled himself to write a letter, tongue in cheek, head down, and
quoting for the other&#8217;s approval as he wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The&mdash;editor&mdash;regrets&mdash;that&mdash;whilst&mdash;he&mdash;appreciates&mdash;the&mdash;beauty
of&mdash;the&mdash;lines&mdash;herewith&mdash;returned&mdash;he&mdash;is&mdash;unable&mdash;to&mdash;make&mdash;use
of&mdash;them&mdash;owing&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to a halt and invited the prompt. None coming, he
glanced over his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it owing to, Netherby? I&#8217;m such a beastly poor liar.
You&#8217;ve been on the press so much longer. Hustle your vivid
imagination and chuck us an excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only a humorist, Oliver&mdash;humour must walk knee-deep in
truth. I do not travel on Romance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up!... No good chucking the idiot roughly.... It&#8217;s
beastly long.... We&#8217;ll chuck it for length, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme smiled at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are possessed of the magnificent carelessness
of the gods&mdash;and I never interfere with religious bodies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll turned to his writing again, and there was a steady scratching
of pen on paper.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme sat for awhile, his face seamed with comic lines of
grim amusement:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said at last&mdash;&#8220;I suppose we have read the poem,
Oliver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>I</i> haven&#8217;t. But <i>you</i> can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme moved uneasily in his seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no. No thanks, Oliver. We&#8217;ll take it as read.&#8221;</p>

<p>He coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Oliver, have you got the dummy for next week&#8217;s issue
over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll licked, sealed, and thumped the letter on the desk:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ah, yes&mdash;I&#8217;m sitting on it and a bunch of keys to remind me.&#8221;
He took a bunch of keys from under him, and put them in his
trousers pocket, then lugged out from beneath him the dummy form of
the review in its brown-paper cover. He opened it, and wetting his
finger on his lip, he flipped through the leaves with their proofs pasted
in position for guidance to the printer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Netherby.&#8221; He held up the booklet, pointing to a
blank space. &#8220;The governor said I was to tell you we had better
complete this column with a poem&mdash;says verse gives a pleasant
appearance to the page.&#8221; He dropped the dummy on the desk in
front of him. &#8220;It&#8217;s an awful bore, Netherby,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but that
bundle of poems he gave me the other day took up such a lot of space
on my desk that I flung them into the waste-paper basket. Can&#8217;t you
knock up about twenty lines of amorous matter? I promise not to
whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme smiled grimly, sighed, took up a pen, and,
drawing a sheet of paper to him, prepared to write....</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth had been with this literary venture from
the start. He had begun as office-boy; and as each member of the
original staff had fallen out, at the stern prunings of necessity, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
been promoted to their places, until he sat alone, as leader-writer,
humorist, topical poet, sentimentalist, sub-editor, office lad, and
general usefulness. Scrupulous to the smallest detail, reliable in the
performance of the minutest fraction of his bond, he got through his
work with the facility of a man of affairs; and, like all busy men,
finding time for everything, he had spent his hours of leisure outside
the office in the humane atmosphere of the theatre, in the tragic fellowship
of the street, in the eternal fresh comedy of the city&#8217;s by-ways,
and in the company of the mighty masters of his tongue; in this, the
best school of education in all the round world, he had acquired such
a knowledge of letters, such a taste for the niceties of the written word,
and such a mastery in its use, as would have astounded, as indeed it
was destined to astound, even them that thought they knew him to
his fullest powers.</p>

<p>The other, the editor&#8217;s son, Oliver Baddlesmere, had come to the
office to complete establishment straight out of the schoolroom some
months back. He had been brought in to reduce the pressure of
clerking work, and, owing to extreme youth and inexperience, had
been given the simpler duties to perform, so that he came naturally
and as a matter of course to preside over the destinies of the poet&#8217;s
corner and to impart information to a hungry world from the battered
volumes of an encyclop√¶dia, and suchlike heavy books of reference,
the weight of which, in the intervals of airily relieving the world&#8217;s
thirst for knowledge, the boy used for the purpose of pressing prints&mdash;of
which he was gathering a collection from the illustrated papers of
the day, pasting them into brown paper scrap-books of his own
making.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme had scarcely got under fair way with the writing
of his amorous matter when the boy whipped round on his office-stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Netherby,&#8221; said he; &#8220;your book <i>is</i> making a splash all
along the Thames. The bookstalls are covered with it&mdash;the whole
blessed town is saffron with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth smiled complacently; sitting back in his
chair, he nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Noll slipped down off the stool, took it up, and carried it over to
the fireplace:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were a chunk-head not to put your name to it!&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
all the same, you know, it&#8217;s been roaring funny to hear the father and
mother talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He vaulted to the top of the high stool, scrambled on to his feet,
and, reaching up, opened the glass face of the clock:</p>

<p>&#8220;It almost bursts me sometimes that I can&#8217;t tell &#8217;em you wrote it,&#8221;
he said. He got on tip-toe and put forward the large hand twenty
minutes, shut the face with a click, turned where he stood, and,
thrusting his hands into his trouser-pockets, he added confidentially:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, Netherby, between you and me and the office ink-pot,
I never thought myself that you could be so uncommon funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth blushed.</p>

<p>Clambering down off the stool, Noll carried it back to his desk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
took down a tall silk hat, ran his coat-sleeve round it, and put it on
his head.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliver,&#8221; said he&mdash;hesitated&mdash;made a pause&mdash;then added nervously:
&#8220;Oliver, I am going to confide in you. In fact, if I don&#8217;t I shall get
some sort of low malarial fever. Now, don&#8217;t treat the confidence
with the giggle of childishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll sighed. He turned, leaped on to his office-stool, swung round,
set his feet on the bar, his elbows on his knees, his chin in his palms,
and, peering at the other out of the shadow from under the brim of
his hat, said gloomily:</p>

<p>&#8220;O lor! the little typewriter girl!... Why the dickens you
don&#8217;t kiss Julia and have done with it, Netherby, I can&#8217;t make out.
Hang it, <i>I</i> have!... It was very nice whilst it lasted, and all that,
but there was nothing in it to write poetry about!&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliver,&#8221; said he, with biting distinctness, &#8220;we have not yet shown
the resentment that your vulgarity courts; but we would remind you
that we may be goaded into flinging the office ink-pot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
stretched out his long arm towards the large zinc well of ink before
him.</p>

<p>Noll slid off the stool, putting it between them with the swift and calculated
strategy of experience, guarding his head with his raised elbow:</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck it, Netherby!&#8221; he bawled, dodging under cover of his desk
warily; and he added in a hoarse aside, jerking his thumb towards
the editor&#8217;s door: &#8220;Chuck it! I withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth put down the heavy ink-pot.</p>

<p>Noll saw out of the corner of his alert eye that honour was satisfied,
and as he ran his finger pensively down a large splash of ink that had
dried on the wall beside his desk, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?... About that confidence!&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme cleared his throat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Oliver, don&#8217;t say anything about this to anyone. It might
make me so ridiculous, and&mdash;professional humorists are keenly
sensitive to ridicule&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lor!&#8221; said Noll, leaving the patch on the wall. &#8220;Get on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is in strict confidence, Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Julia all right enough,&#8221; growled Noll.</p>

<p>Gomme went on, ignoring the comment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, it is one of the penalties of fame that its victims must
appear in the brilliant world of fashion.&#8221; He coughed. &#8220;Come here,
Noll.&#8221; He unlocked and pulled open the drawer before him, and
Noll, aroused to sudden interest, sidled over to him as he brought out
from the drawer a very carefully folded dress-coat. &#8220;Oliver, I&#8217;ve got
a dress-coat. You see, I may have to go into society at any moment,
now that my book has caught the public eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll put out his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at the thing,&#8221; said he eagerly.</p>

<p>Gomme caught his arm and kept him off it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful, Noll!&#8221; he gasped anxiously&mdash;&#8220;gently! or we shan&#8217;t get it
back into its folds.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>He put it away carefully, locked it up, and, sitting back in his chair,
he added gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Noll, as one who has knowledge of the usages of polite
society&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>Gomme touched him on the shoulder nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Noll&mdash;I&#8217;m not accusing you of practising them. But
as one born within the pale of good society&mdash;from no fault of your
own, I admit&mdash;ought one to put scent on the coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll whistled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Je&mdash;hoshaphat!&#8221; said he, &#8220;I never noticed.&#8221; He pushed his
hat back on his head, thrust his hands deep into his breeches pockets,
and fixed a searching eye on experience: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. N-no&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think so. The governor doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth shook his head solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a most awkward point, Oliver&mdash;a most awkward point&mdash;and
somewhat momentous.... One&#8217;s first step at the threshold of a career
should not be a stumble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll&#8217;s face lighted up with a suggestion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what I should do, Netherby. Just scent your handkerchief;
and if it kicks up a beastly lot of notice and makes you
uncomfortable, you can always get rid of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, Oliver!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather. Hand it to a lady and ask her if it is hers. Gives you a
sort of introduction, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme stared aghast:</p>

<p>&#8220;B-but, Oliver, surely one is introduced in society!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather not&mdash;it ain&#8217;t form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; it&#8217;s the new hospitality. But about that scent,
Netherby&mdash;let us try some on me, and I&#8217;ll see if it worries the mother.
The father&#8217;ll soon be nasty about it if it&#8217;s bad form.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme shook his head, and sighed heavily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Oliver, one has to be very careful in one&#8217;s pose on entering a
new world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather!... Do you know, Netherby, it&#8217;s a rummy thing how
one begins to wash one&#8217;s self and think about ornaments and things
when one becomes a man, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A most rummy thing indeed, Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme sighed.</p>

<p>Noll looked at him with interest:</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be wonderful to feel famous,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Gomme gloomily. &#8220;Wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see why you should be so beastly miserable about it,
Netherby. It don&#8217;t hurt, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly, Noll.&#8221; The yellow-haired youth sighed. &#8220;I am only
suffering from the mood of the time.... Pessimism is on the town....
A clerk with any claim to culture must affect Decadence this
season&mdash;and it gives me the hump.&#8221; He coughed. &#8220;Causes me acute
mental discomfort.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Noll snorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I should chuck it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I was a kid I used to
worry if I were not the same as the other kids; but&mdash;hullo!&#8221; He
looked up at the clock. &#8220;It seems to me it&#8217;s about time to go and
get tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>He winked an eye solemnly at Gomme, and whistled his way airily
out of the office. The door swung open, revealing a dingy stair-landing,
shut with a bang, and swallowed him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sound of Noll&#8217;s retreating footsteps on the stair had scarce
faded away into the distant echoes of the street, when the door that
led to the editor&#8217;s room opened, and a well-groomed man of about
thirty-five entered the office. Anthony Baddlesmere was a handsome,
well-set-up fellow&mdash;indeed, it was as much from his father as from his
mother that Noll inherited his good looks. He was handsome to the
degree of beauty; and this it was, perhaps, which, in spite of the easy
carriage of the body and the subtle air of good-breeding, gave the
impression of some indecision of character in the man. Or it may
have been that this indecision was increased by a certain embarrassment
as he endeavoured to get a firm note into his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gomme&mdash;have you completed the dummy yet&mdash;for this week&#8217;s
issue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme got up from his chair and searched for the dummy amongst
the papers on Noll&#8217;s desk. But Anthony Baddlesmere had seated
himself on the corner of the desk, and, fingering a paper-knife, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;never mind. There&#8217;s another matter, Netherby.... It&#8217;s
some years since I started this sorry venture in this office.&#8221; He
sighed, and passed his hand over his forehead wearily&mdash;&#8220;more years
than I care to remember. You, the office-boy, were a lank lad of
thirteen&mdash;I a young man, full of literary enthusiasms.... I tried to
sell the public artistic wares&#8221;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&#8220;tried to
show them vital things&mdash;real things, instead of sham&mdash;tried to encourage
promising youth&#8221;&mdash;he laughed sadly&mdash;&#8220;and a nice waste-paper
basket we&#8217;ve made of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung his foot and kicked the waste-paper basket into the
middle of the room, sending its contents flying over the floor.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a great deal of the promise of youth goes into
the waste-paper basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere laughed uncomfortably; the laugh died out
of his eyes, obliterated by a frown:</p>

<p>&#8220;Downstairs,&#8221; he went on, as though repeating an unpleasant task
he had set himself&mdash;&#8220;downstairs they have given the public trash&mdash;cheap.
And I have lost.... In me the literary enthusiasm, a little
chilled, perhaps, remains; but the youth has gone. As for you&mdash;you
are office-boy still, to all purposes, and lank still&mdash;but, lord! how you
have grown!&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme looked down at his scanty trousers and sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I <i>have</i> grown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! like a scandal,&#8221; said Baddlesmere; and a gleam of merriment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shot into his eyes, ran round the corners of his mouth, and
vanished. &#8220;Gomme,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we are at the end of our resources.
This is our last week in these rooms.... The office is bare&mdash;my
home is bare. All my money&mdash;all my wife&#8217;s literary success&mdash;all have
gone to feed the printing machine. It&#8217;s great inky maw has swallowed
everything.... However, there is no debt&mdash;except to you. But that
is a heavy one. My conscience tells me that you ought not to have
been allowed to remain here and share in the collapse; you ought to
have been promoted&mdash;to have been sent to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated&mdash;stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where, sir?&#8221; asked the yellow-haired youth.</p>

<p>The bald fact was that Baddlesmere had never given the matter
a thought until this disaster was upon him. He smiled sadly, and
added vaguely:</p>

<p>&#8220;No place would have been good enough for you, Gomme....
You should have been promoted long ago....&#8221; He roused and
faced the position boldly: &#8220;But you have been such a good friend to
me and to the boy&mdash;so useful a part of this office, that I am afraid I
have treated you like a part of myself, and have come by habit to think
the hat that covered my head covered yours.... Dame Fortune
has knocked the hat off&mdash;and I find there were two heads inside it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, we can look her in the face without the hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Gomme&mdash;but I have looked over your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has saved your eyes from the commonplace, sir, and my heart
from a bad chill. I wouldn&#8217;t have missed the past years in this office
for a fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Gomme; nor I&mdash;nor I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have made a man of me,&#8221; the youth added hoarsely.</p>

<p>Baddlesmere put his hand on the other&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you should have been promoted&mdash;you should have been promoted....
And I could so easily have sent you to a better billet.&#8221;
He sat down, and, fidgeting with the paper-knife again, he added,
after a pause: &#8220;By the way, Gomme, I wish you did not write such a
shocking bad hand.&#8221; He smiled, half jesting, half serious. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you practise writing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s face became a dull, expressionless mask:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, sir,&#8221; he said grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How? You have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve written a book,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Baddlesmere whistled:</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you have!... Ah, Gomme, everybody writes books
nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they read mine, sir,&#8221; said Netherby Gomme. He dived his
hand into the breast-pocket of his coat, and, taking out a bundle
of press-cuttings, drew a much-thumbed one from the others.
&#8220;Listen to the mighty Thrumsby Burrage in <i>The Discriminator</i>,
sir.&#8221; He read out the paragraph:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We have here a refined humorist, whose work is stamped with the
hall-mark of genius.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Baddlesmere nodded; he was only half listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;<i>hall-mark of genius</i> is Thrumsby Burrage.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Gomme went on with a yawning travesty of the pulpit manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>In the present day it is indeed a veritable intellectual treat to come
upon the subtle workmanship of a man of large experience of life&mdash;workmanship
marked by that delicate wit which grows only to perfection
in the cloistered atmosphere of scholarship.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;<i>cloistered atmosphere</i> is Thrumsby Burrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s eyes twinkled:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We rejoice that a new man of genius has risen amongst us, and we
do not hesitate to say that the anonymous writer of</i> &#8216;The Tragedy
of the Ridiculous&#8217; <i>is that man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere shook off boredom, stood up slowly, stared at
the gaunt yellow-haired youth before him in frank tribute of bewilderment,
and said at last with hoarse surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> wrote this book, Gomme?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Netherby Gomme simply; &#8220;but when I write my
tragedy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Baddlesmere clapped a hand on his shoulder, and pleasure danced
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, good God! you are famous, man&mdash;famous!... And you
must be making a fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir&mdash;I sold the thing for a few pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere strode up and down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, man,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I have been trying all my life, and with
every advantage, to create a work of art such as this; and here are
you, a mere stripling&mdash;damn it, scarcely out of knickerbockers&mdash;though,
on my soul, you are nearly as old as your trousers&mdash;here are you, a
mere stripling, famous!&#8221; He came to him, gripped him affectionately
by the shoulder. &#8220;Of all men that I know, I would rather this thing
had come to you than to any.&#8221; He turned and got to striding up and
down the room again. &#8220;Famous!&mdash;at least you will be as soon as you
give out your own name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s face had flushed a little with the praise:</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when I write my tragedy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Baddlesmere turned on him sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tragedy be hanged!&#8221; said he. &#8220;My dear Gomme, you&#8217;ve got to
recognise that the world never takes its humorists seriously. It&#8217;s
always looking for the joke in their tragedies.... Which reminds
me, Gomme, I&#8217;m afraid to-morrow must see us out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s face lost its mask:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir!&#8221; he faltered&mdash;fidgeting nervously with the papers by his
hand&mdash;&#8220;what are <i>you</i> going to do? and Noll?&mdash;and Mrs. Baddlesmere&mdash;when
the blinds are pulled down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Baddlesmere strode over to the window, and, gazing down into the
dusk of the chilly street below, made no answer. He stood so for a
long while, and wondered.</p>

<p>He wondered if he <i>had</i> given the public vital things!</p>

<p>His mind ran rapidly over the failure of his scheme&mdash;a scheme that,
as he now saw, had been inherent with failure at its very inception.
He saw now, as he stood there ruined by it, that it was folly to expect
a public to buy literature built up on the mere brilliant literary
exercises in technical skill of a smart group of young fellows who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
really had no claim upon the consideration of the world, nothing to
say, no gift but a capacity to use the machinery of letters prettily;
who had had positively nothing to offer to the world but old idioms
freshly arrayed in pretty clothes&mdash;make-believe kings at a calico-ball.
These had been but smart mediocrities&mdash;not an ounce of wisdom
amongst them all. It came to him now with grim irony, as he
stood there in confession to the clear-eyed judge of Self, that for all
their cackle of literary style and their contempt for everyone else,
these men had uttered no single thought worth preserving&mdash;that they
had left their youth behind and were growing bald a-top, and full-blown
and ordinary&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, the work of this Netherby Gomme. He knew now as he ran
over the years, that all the best work had come from this youth&#8217;s pen&mdash;about
the only one of them all who had not given himself airs, who
had put down the absolute truth as he whimsically saw it, who had
worked and wrought amid bare walls and in hours snatched from toil-won
leisure, whilst they all sat and prated of what they intended to do,
and of how it should be done.</p>

<p>He turned from the window into the lighted office, and his glance
fell on his son Noll&#8217;s desk. It was the only artistic corner in the room&mdash;the
prints, mounted on brown paper, which the boy had tacked to
the wall, had a decorative effect that showed rare artistic taste in one
so young.</p>

<p>A touch of pride came into the man&#8217;s eyes, and went out in a frown.
Netherby Gomme, watching him in alert silence, with delicate tact
uttered no word.</p>

<p>As Baddlesmere moved towards the editor&#8217;s room he asked
abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows, sir,&#8221; said Netherby Gomme airily.</p>

<p>The door closed on the editor, and Gomme heard the slam of the
outer door, which told that Baddlesmere had begun to descend the
stair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows!&#8221; Gomme shook his head. &#8220;Playing with a
sewer, most like.... But God is very good to boys.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h3></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is discovered that, likely enough from an Ancestor who was
Master of the Horse to King Harry the Eighth, Master Oliver
had inherited some Gift of Horseplay, together with a Keen Eye
for a Fine Leg on a Woman.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Netherby Gomme</span> had been sitting some time writing at his desk
when the door behind him was stealthily opened and Noll&#8217;s head
popped round its edge. There was a sharp click of a pea in a tin
pea-shooter as the youngster let fly a careful aim at Gomme&#8217;s poll.</p>

<p>Gomme jumped, and scratched the back of his neck irritably:</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse it, Noll!&#8221; he growled testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naughty!&#8221; said Noll, coming into the room, but giving the yellow-haired
youth a wide circle as he moved to his desk, and keeping
a wary eye on him under a magnificent pretence of carelessness.
&#8220;Caught you on the raw that time, I think, my ink-stained warrior!&#8221;
he added cheerfully; but the fire was gone out of the old jest, and
it was borne in on the youngster that the oft-repeated joke is somewhat
of a damp squib. He broke the tin pea-shooter across his knee,
and flung the two pieces into the empty grate. Strolling over to his
desk, he took up the office-stool in his arms and carried it to the dusty
fireplace. As he scrambled on to the stool Netherby Gomme watched
him under his brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am relieved to see, Noll,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;that you remember your
manhood and your pose as a literary prophet, and intend in future to
split hairs instead of spitting peas.&#8221; He scratched his head irritably
as the other, standing a-tip-toe on the stool, reached up and put back
the minute-hand of the clock. &#8220;Confound it!&#8221; he added, as Noll
shut the glass face with a snap, and came down gloomily off his stool&mdash;&#8220;the
whole world seems to be suffering from the vice of forced humour
in these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be waspish, Netherby,&#8221; said the youngster.</p>

<p>He carried the stool back to his desk, took off his silk hat, hung it
up, and solemnly mounted into his seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; he said, and he sighed, &#8220;I do feel beastly young at
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted Netherby Gomme drily&mdash;&#8220;you weren&#8217;t very long
over your tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... As a matter of fact, I haven&#8217;t had any tea. I had to dodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the governor, so I popped into the office below to call on your little
typewriter girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme moved peevishly in his chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Noll, for Heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t call Julia my <i>typewriter
girl</i>!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;d think you were talking of a sewing-machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;she is a bit of a sewing-machine&mdash;when she isn&#8217;t typewriting.&#8221;
He suddenly disappeared over the side of the stool and took up a
defensive attitude beyond his desk. &#8220;Chuck it!&#8221; he bawled&mdash;&#8220;shut
up, Netherby!... Put that ink-pot down and I&#8217;ll tell you the whole
tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll climbed on to his stool again as the keen glitter went out of
Gomme&#8217;s eyes, and, sitting perched there with his back against the
desk, he said calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Julia is missing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme stared at him anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Missing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m&mdash;h&#8217;m!&#8221; said he. &#8220;They are getting rather fussy about it
downstairs, and inclined to be nasty.&#8221; He assumed an editorial
manner and continued: &#8220;We regret to state that there has been
marked uneasiness at Messrs. Rollit&#8217;s typewriting offices owing to the
fact that Miss Julia Wynne has not been heard of for the last hour;
and this conduct, which might have passed unnoticed in any ordinary
female clerk, has caused considerable anxiety in the office where she
usually carries on her avocation, for, owing to the regular habits and
exemplary conduct of the young person in question, the half-starved
beauty of whose Burne-Jones-like profile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not yet thrown the office ink-pot, Oliver!&#8221; said Netherby
Gomme grimly.</p>

<p>Noll, guarding his head with his arm, peered out from beneath his
elbow:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but really, Netherby, it was beastly hard luck her being out.
I like to go and gaze at her. She has such a jolly nice mouth. I should
like to kiss it&mdash;it would do her a lot of good....&#8221; He disappeared
over the stool. &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Put it down and I&#8217;ll chuck
it. I say, Netherby,&#8221; he added confidentially, coming out into the
open and disarming resentment by trusting Gomme&#8217;s honour; &#8220;I saw
a ripping girl to-day. She gave me quite a thrill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme sat back in his chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, Noll!&#8221; said he, putting his fingers together, elbows on
chair-arm&mdash;&#8220;this is most interesting.... What age was the lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite twelve or thirteen. None of your Burne-Jones-like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He ducked his head under his arm and made for his desk backwards.
He scrambled on to his stool as he saw that the other was not
for war:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she <i>was</i> a girl, that! Rich warm hair&mdash;reddish. Plumpish.
Jolly way of walking....&#8221; He paused for a moment and added
critically: &#8220;She went off a bit in the legs&mdash;but&mdash;they mostly do at that
age.... I offered her chocolates.... She sniffed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very encouraging, Oliver!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;It <i>was</i> rather a blow,&#8221; said Noll. &#8220;But I think a woman ought
to be offish at first. I don&#8217;t like &#8217;em too easily captured myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask,&#8221; said Gomme grimly, &#8220;if she be a lady of position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;her antecedents are somewhat humble. Her father is a&mdash;well&mdash;he&#8217;s
a butcher. But every tragedy should have comic relief&mdash;shouldn&#8217;t
it, Netherby?&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme shook his head solemnly where he sat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, you are very, very old. Let us try to be young again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so beastly slow being young,&#8221; grumbled Noll. &#8220;When I&#8217;m a
man&mdash;Jeroos&#8217;lum! I <i>should</i> like to be a man&mdash;and shave!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then you&#8217;ll damn the razor.... Ah, Noll, it is with the razor
that youth cuts its throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. The boy sat brooding on some perplexing
problem; the yellow-haired youth watched him.</p>

<p>Noll broke the silence. He slipped down off his high seat, and came
over to Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Netherby, your book <i>is</i> terrific though!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Noll&mdash;you overwhelm me.... Ah, Noll, if all the world
were as prejudiced an admirer as you are&mdash;and as frankly honest in the
statement of their admiration&mdash;I might be a great man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Netherby,&#8221; said Noll, eyeing him critically&mdash;&#8220;when did you
discover you were clever?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;er&mdash;when people began to tell me my own stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could write that sort of comic rot,&#8221; said Noll enviously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, it is easy enough to be funny. <i>I</i> envy the man of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired youth got up from his chair, lank and lean and
awkward, and paced the room with prowling gait.</p>

<p>&#8220;To feel the blood tingle through one in hair&#8217;s-breadth escapes&mdash;to
use one&#8217;s strength&mdash;to live, man, live!... To beat grips with life and
danger and death, instead of writing lyrics or other tomfoolery about
it, or about what you think other people ought to think about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck it, Netherby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme, pacing up and down the room, took no heed of the interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Writing history across the face of the world!... That is a bigger
thing than spilling ink.... I know what it feels like a little,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;The boxing sergeant knocked me down five times running in rapid
succession at the gymnasium last night, and at the first fall I felt the
transferred glory of what he must have felt. There is wondrous delight,
a sense of the sublime, in conquest&mdash;even with the boxing-gloves on!...
Of course, now, it would be something to write a <i>tragedy</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll snorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tragedy&#8217;s all piffle! You don&#8217;t go to a theatre to sniff....
Give me a jolly good pantomime for an artistic jaunt. Shush! the
governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He vaulted on to his desk-stool as the door was flung open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cafoshulam&mdash;it&#8217;s Julia!&#8221; he cried, swinging round on his stool
again as the door shut with a slam, and a pretty young woman in neat
black dress ran up to Netherby Gomme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Netherby,&#8221; she gasped, seizing his arm, &#8220;there&#8217;s a horror of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
man keeps following me about&mdash;from the time I was at the coffee-shop&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve been afraid to go back to the office lest he should follow me
there. And so, at last, I&#8217;ve run up here. What am I to do? The
man frightens me out of my wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Julia&mdash;keep calm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme stroked her hand, and, leading her quickly to the editor&#8217;s
room, threw open the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Julia&mdash;in here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia grasped his arm as he was about to shut the door upon her:</p>

<p>&#8220;No personal violence, please, Netherby. You won&#8217;t hurt him&mdash;will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Julia,&#8221; said he, hurrying her into the room, &#8220;I am surprised
at such a suggestion!&#8221; He shut the door, and, turning his back
upon it, he added grimly: &#8220;Personal violence is quite contrary to the
traditions of this office, Noll&mdash;it should, in our judgment, be the very
last resource.&#8221; He coughed. &#8220;The office broom, I fear, Noll, is in
the editor&#8217;s cupboard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll whooped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooroosh!&#8221; cried he&mdash;&#8220;we haven&#8217;t had a row in the office for
nearly five weeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a loud knock.</p>

<p>Noll whipped round on his high stool, and was immediately
engrossed in the heavy work of his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; cried Netherby Gomme.</p>

<p>The door on to the landing was thrown open and revealed the
figure of an elaborately dressed exquisite, who entered the room
deliberately, diffusing scents&mdash;one of those well-polished, shining
beings who never seem to catch a speck of dust. He had an
hereditary qualification to pass for a gentleman&mdash;he knew how to
dress for the part. He could strain good taste in adornment to the
uttermost stretch without breaking it. He stood with the arrogant
self-assurance that largely stands for good-breeding amongst the
inane, and though the perfection of his clothes&#8217; fit could not hide the
fact that the lamp of intelligence burnt but gutteringly at the top where
were his wits, he had the self-respect to ignore his defects. He looked
calmly round the room, and, taking a card with deliberate coolness
from a silver cardcase, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will someone&mdash;ah&mdash;kindly give my card to&mdash;ah&mdash;that most comely
young lady who&mdash;ah&mdash;has just come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme walked over to him and took the card, which the exquisite
held out to him between the first and second fingers of his lavender-gloved
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will no one offer me a chair?&#8221; the affected voice asked plaintively.</p>

<p>Gomme motioned him to a seat by the empty fireplace, and the
other strolled thither and sat down on the edge of it with deliberate
care. The seat was gone&mdash;a bristling hollow only left. He took off
his hat and looked about the room with a cold, critical stare.</p>

<p>Gomme took the card to Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott,&#8221; he read in a gruff whisper,
handing the card to the youngster; and he added grimly: &#8220;Destiny
was against the Thing from the beginning, Oliver. A man like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was bound to go on all fours and eat grass.&#8221; He raised his voice:
&#8220;The editor&#8217;s room, please,&#8221; he said. And, as Noll scrambled down
leisurely from his seat, the yellow-haired youth added under his breath
solemnly: &#8220;Oliver, select the best office-broom, and as I cast him
down the stairs, kindly crack the hero&#8217;s shins. It will confuse his
retreat. War is an art&mdash;not a vulgar scrimmage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll solemnly carried the card into the editor&#8217;s office. Gomme
went to his seat, sat down, and aggressively paid no heed to the
Thing.</p>

<p>The exquisite became nettled. Said he affectedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an awfully smart office-girl of yours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme rose slowly from his chair, and, walking over to
him, stood and looked down at him with contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a judge!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;a sort of overdressed Paris
awarding the apple&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; protested the exquisite Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott; &#8220;you
are quite mistaken. I have never been in Paris, and I&#8217;m not at all
keen about apples.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme laughed loud. Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott fidgeted uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the editor?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Gomme smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said&mdash;and added drily: &#8220;Luckily for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why luck-i-ly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The editor kicks like a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott sniggered uneasily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; he drawled. It was faintly borne in upon him that he
was neither shining nor making an impression. His eyes ranged aimlessly
round the room, and he added fatuously:</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is the sort of place where you literary fellows hang out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme stared at him in grim silence.</p>

<p>The exquisite Ponsonby shifted in his seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;None of my people have ever been literary,&#8221; he drawled; &#8220;they
all belonged to the virile professions.... At least, I <i>suppose</i> that&#8217;s
the office-girl.... However, as I said before, I&#8217;m not a literary man
myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s eyes glowed threateningly, but the resplendent fool seated
before him was too heavy-witted a dullard to hear anything but the
cackle of his own voice, or to be alert to anything but the sordid desire
of his own eyes.</p>

<p>Gomme laughed drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man?... You&#8217;re not a man!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott was genuinely shocked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped. He saw that this yellow-haired, gaunt other man, a
loose-limbed, powerful fellow, was glaring at him in anything but
friendly fashion, and he was dumb.</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s level voice went calmly on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh!&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;re a perambulating monkey, scented and got
up and flung upon the town by Providence to remind us all from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
we came&mdash;and to what we may return&mdash;if we forget that we were meant
to grow into God&#8217;s good image.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re a common fellow!&#8221; said Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott.</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s keen eyes remained fixed on him with a steady contempt,
that ate even into this dunce&#8217;s conceit. He went on, giving judgment
on the travesty of manhood that sat before him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly fool! It&#8217;s disgusting that a pretty woman can&#8217;t walk
down the high streets of the most civilized city in the world without
the risk of some painted peacock of an &#8217;Arry like yourself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Arry, indeed!&#8221; bleated the exquisite. Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott
was wounded in his most religious parts. &#8220;I have the blood of the
Plantagenets in my veins,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He was very indignant. He spoke with simple faith, as if of the
certainty of a glorious resurrection.</p>

<p>Gomme turned, and called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door, Oliver!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door swung open, and discovered Noll at the head of the stairway,
gripping a long broom in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliver,&#8221; said Netherby, and his eyes shone, &#8220;this is, I think,
positively the first occasion on which we have flung a genuine Plantagenet
down the office-stairs. It is indeed an emotional moment....
I am thrilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a grab at the throat of Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott, who
evaded it with an upward fling of the elbow as he scrambled in a ladylike
way to his patent-leather feet, and put himself into an affected
attitude of defence, his silk hat in one hand and his cane in the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&mdash;what are you&mdash;do&mdash;ing?&#8221; he asked plaintively.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme laughed, eyeing him as might a hungry dog a
bone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, Noll; take careful aim,&#8221; said he, as the exquisite began to
back towards the door. &#8220;What a destiny, to bark the shins of the
royal house of Anjou!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll could be seen at the head of the stairway, beyond the open
door, weighing the broom to get the balance and the grip, and swinging
it with careful aim at the place where he calculated would come the
shins of the exquisite Ponsonby.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme pounced upon the retreating body of Ponsonby
Wattles Ffolliott, and this time he got his fingers inside the exquisite&#8217;s
collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go&mdash;away!&#8221; gasped Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott.</p>

<p>There was a sharp struggle as Gomme, gripping him by the throat,
forced him backwards to the open doorway, nearly jerking the complaining
head off the narrow shoulders, until the room swam round
dazedly in the revolving addled wits of the miserable man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he gasped&mdash;his plaintive voice in pained remonstrance
as they swung round the doorpost&mdash;&#8220;this is&mdash;horribly&mdash;sudden!&#8221; He
groaned.</p>

<p>In his frenzy his gloved hand made a grab at the handle of the door,
which shut upon them with a loud slam.</p>

<p>Julia opened the office-door stealthily, and put forth an anxious head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
She could hear the scuffle outside. She ran into the room in a state of
nervous trepidation:</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; she said; ran back into the office; shut herself
in.</p>

<p>A yell of victory from Noll told that the office broom had got home
amongst the shins of the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>Julia opened the door a little way again and peeped nervously into
the office.</p>

<p>She saw the door from the stairway fling open, and Gomme stroll
in, adjusting his coat and smoothing down his hair with his hands; and
through the open door there came the sound of fugitive anxious feet
going nervously before pursuit, rushing frantically down the stairs,
leaping and stumbling. Noll, with the broom poised in his hand, was
leaning over the balustrade, his legs and back exquisitely thrilled, and
as he flung the broom he burst into a cheer, his aim carrying away the
silk hat of the fugitive exquisite below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ripping!&#8221; cried Noll, and dived down the stairs after the hat.</p>

<p>Gomme halted, and listened.</p>

<p>The distant sound of feet, rapidly descending the stairs, told of
the recuperative force and staying power of the Plantagenets even in
defeat.</p>

<p>There was a loud crash of glass.</p>

<p>Julia started and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>A bland smile came over the face of Netherby Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have repeatedly pointed out to the landlord,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
the large glass door at the foot of the stairs is a source of considerable
danger to any person proceeding down the staircase at an accelerated
pace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia came out from behind the door, and ran to Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;Netherby,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it made a horrible noise.&#8221; She wrung her
hands, grasped his arm. &#8220;I hope to goodness you haven&#8217;t dashed
that stupid man&#8217;s brains out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby put his hand on her shoulder gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be done, Julia,&#8221; said he. &#8220;No jury would convict on so
weak a charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears sprang into Julia&#8217;s eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to see men quarrel,&#8221; said she petulantly; &#8220;they always push
each other about instead of reasoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme laughed loud and long:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Julia,&#8221; said he, tenderly taking her hand in his; &#8220;there are
some things beyond reason. Take ourselves. The reasons why a
certain little woman finds reasons for not being reasonable&mdash;oh,
bother!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door shut with a loud slam, and Noll came into the room, trailing
the office broom after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Julia,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it&#8217;s very soothing and nice, but there&#8217;s
some one coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shot the broom into a corner, and vaulted on to his high stool,
as Julia put herself as far from Netherby as the office would allow.</p>

<p>Footsteps came to the door.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Master Oliver comes to the Conclusion that, to complete the
Dramatic Picture, Greatness should have known the Hair-Shirt
and the Makeshifts of Adversity.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door swung open, and a handsome woman of about thirty walked
into the dingy room. She was possessed of that calm and the fresh
easy manner and movement that come of generations of women who
have exacted respect from their fellows&mdash;and given it.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme went to meet her, and as she shut the door she
held out her gloved hand to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Mrs. Baddlesmere?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Netherby?&#8221; It was a charming voice that spoke.
&#8220;Julia, too! why this thusness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia blushed and smiled embarrassedly:</p>

<p>Mrs. Baddlesmere turned to the boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard at work, Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll shrugged his shoulders, where he sat hunched on his office-stool:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mother, I miss my tobacco,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baddlesmere laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid, Noll. Remember, you promised me&mdash;for a fortnight,
you ridiculous child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll smiled dryly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother still thinks I am in knickerbockers,&#8221; said he. &#8220;She
wanted me to wear a sailor hat last summer with ribbons hanging
down behind and <i>H.M.S. Sardine</i> on it in gold letters. Women have
the strangest ideas about men&#8217;s clothes&mdash;even the married ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere went to the boy and put her arm through his.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an inky state you get into, my dear Noll!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Literature is not to be made without the spilling of much ink,&#8221;
said Noll.</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere sighed sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Noll, after to-day you need not trouble with the spilling of
ink,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Baddlesmere turned to Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, Netherby, you know that our days at the old office are
over&mdash;that we have failed to make the ends of this paper meet!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Baddlesmere has told me,&#8221; he said simply. It struck him
painfully, in spite of the calm of the delicate woman who stood before
him, that she too had been told the worst not very long: &#8220;I am
afraid,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it is a very anxious time for you, Mrs. Baddlesmere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Netherby; but we must be packing what few things we want
to keep.&#8221; Cheerily drawing off her gloves, she added with sudden
seriousness: &#8220;I had not realized the position until Anthony told me a
day or two ago, but within twenty-four hours I had settled everything&mdash;even
the debts. And we have just taken a top-floor within half-an-hour
of Charing Cross. It&#8217;s very airy&mdash;and it&#8217;s a large room&mdash;and the
landlady&#8217;s a dear soul.&#8221; A twinkle came into her eyes. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
afraid we must give up our weekly receptions.&#8221; Her shoulders gave
the slightest suspicion of a shrug, and a serious catch came into her
voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m only distressed to think, Netherby, that your loyal
friendship to us has brought you no richer reward than a share in our
disaster&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a heavy step on the landing without. Caroline Baddlesmere
dashed a handkerchief across her eyes, and, opening the editor&#8217;s
door, she signed to Julia to slip away with her.</p>

<p>There was a loud knock.</p>

<p>A big, gloomy man entered, flung the door to again dramatically,
and strode solemnly into the room. His lank iron-grey hair, the
massive pale clean-shaven face, the seedy frock-coat tightly buttoned
across his body, his close-fitting much-knee&#8217;d trousers, and deliberate
calculated stride, all gave him the air of a decayed actor of the old
school; and his large gesture and full dramatic voice, that gave value
to every word he spoke, heightened the impression; whilst the loose
black cloak that was flung back from his shoulders finished it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Eustace Lovegood,&#8221; he said tragically, and brought his cane
down upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Gomme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, young man,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I require your confirmation of the
pathetic fact. I dined out last night&#8221;&mdash;he touched his forehead
with his forefinger wearily&mdash;&#8220;and my most unprofitable intellect
reminds me of what my bank-book and the neglect of the world have
long since ceased to remind me&mdash;that my name is Eustace and Lovegood....
I must see the Editor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Gomme waved him to the chair by the fireplace. &#8220;Be
seated, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood looked at the forbidding chair, then glowered at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will <i>not</i> be seated.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Gomme rose, and, hiding a smile behind a cough, moved
towards the editor&#8217;s office, the tragic eyes of Eustace Lovegood
turned to the boy Noll, where he sat, still as a statue, on his office-stool:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Oliver!&#8221; said the big man; and a smile shot into his eyes.
&#8220;How is the boy Oliver?&#8221; He was moving towards Noll when the
office-door opened, and Caroline, followed by the others, entered
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah, Caroline&mdash;a pleasant surprise indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>He took off his hat with the grand air, and swept her a low bow.
He strode to her, and, raising her hand to his lips, kissed her white
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you too, Miss Julia? I am your servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all smiled affectionately&mdash;he was obviously an old friend.</p>

<p>As his voice ceased there was a brisk step on the landing outside&mdash;a
sharp knock&mdash;and the door flew open. A little man with a big
moustache entered fussily, on jerky restless feet, and glanced sharply
round the room; he was best known as a minor critic&mdash;one of those
men who condemn everything they do not understand:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Mrs. Baddlesmere?&#8221; he said, with a harsh voice and
nervous manner.</p>

<p>His eyes glanced away to Julia, to whom he nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Miss Julia?&#8221;</p>

<p>His glance jumped to Noll where he sat observant, chin in palms,
on the high office-chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Master Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten your hat, Fosse,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The fussy little man snapped off his hat:</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have&mdash;so I have!&#8221; he yapped.</p>

<p>Eustace Lovegood took three heavy paces towards Gomme, and
said, with a black frown, in a confidential aside:</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh! that dreadful fussy little man of rude health&mdash;and the
scarlet voice!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fosse turned at the grumbled bass:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Lovegood?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Lovegood solemnly&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he added in growled aside to Netherby Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish this person would not be familiar with my health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fosse skipped nervously towards Caroline Baddlesmere:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;eh! Well, Mrs. Baddlesmere; and how&#8217;s the book?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere&#8217;s shoulders gave the slightest possible shrug:</p>

<p>&#8220;My book is dead, Mr. Fosse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse folded his arms:</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Honestly, it lacked the vital element of
style.&#8221; He blew out his narrow little chest&mdash;he had the floor. &#8220;You
have tragedy&mdash;pathos&mdash;and&mdash;er, yes&mdash;comedy. Yes, you have a certain
amount of humour&mdash;a marvellous amount, indeed, for a woman, if you
will excuse my saying so. Yet, comedy but raises a laugh&#8221;&mdash;he
shrugged his little shoulders&mdash;&#8220;and there you are!... Tragedy but
appeals to the emotions&mdash;draws a tear&#8221;&mdash;he shrugged his little
shoulders again&mdash;&#8220;and there you are!... But Style is independent
of laughter or tears. Tragedy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pish!&#8221; pshawed Eustace Lovegood. He stepped a pace into the
room: &#8220;Tragedy!&#8221; he roared scornfully, glaring at the fussy minor
critic before him; and even the light of the conceited little Egoism
seemed to flicker out, blown aside by the big man&#8217;s contempt:
&#8220;Tragedy is the mere melodrama of life&mdash;the shedding of blood but
the indecent accident of death.... It is comedy, the expression of
the joy of living, that is worthy the serious attention of genius.&#8221; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
rose on his toes and made an elephantine gesture of sending off
butterflies into the air. &#8220;The exquisite little <i>mot</i>&mdash;the fairy fabric
of a dainty paradox&mdash;the swift epigram! Think of it&mdash;the rapture
of the exquisite agony that is in the elaborate workmanship to create
the spontaneous repartee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Fosse was not quite sure whether he was being chaffed. He
was one of those men so wanting in humour that he accused the
humorous of lacking humour. He knew that his thin voice sank to
insignificance in the deep thunder of this big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes. N&#8217;yes,&#8221; he said&mdash;and glanced uneasily at the others.
Gomme&#8217;s face was a stolid impenetrable mask.</p>

<p>Fosse skipped over to Gomme, and seizing him by the coat-lapel he
said nervously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr. Gomme&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Eustace Lovegood snorted and strolled away to where Caroline stood.</p>

<p>Fosse blinked uncomfortably at Gomme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;as a matter of fact&mdash;I came on business,&#8221; said he. His harsh
jerky voice dropped into confidential whisper. &#8220;Might I beg of you
to put in a little paragraph about my coming novel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme nodded.</p>

<p>The little critic coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;you could hint&mdash;just <i>hint</i> that it is somewhat daringly original!
I don&#8217;t even mind if you hint that it is rather&mdash;sinful&mdash;with&mdash;er&mdash;just
a little suggestion that I am the English Maupassant, eh!... I can
assure you,&#8221; he added, touching Gomme&#8217;s arm, &#8220;I can <i>assure</i> you that
Thrumsby Burrage of <i>The Discriminator</i> said so at dinner last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that Thrumsby Burrage drank,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he? Indeed! Very sad!&#8221; The fussy little man&#8217;s foxy eyes
turned inwards, searching through his quick weasel intelligence to
discover the connection, but failed: &#8220;Very sad indeed! Genius is
nearly always wanting in the moral attributes.... But to return&mdash;if
you would suggest that my work contains that&mdash;er&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;That combination of religion and immorality which is so alluring
to the British public in a work of art,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;yes, I <i>quite</i>
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse roused from his self-concentration:</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8217;yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;but perhaps if I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Fosse; I was about to suggest that you should
write it yourself; and we&#8217;ll whip it into shape&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delighted, my dear fellow, delighted!&#8221; The fussy little man&#8217;s
fussy little feet began to shuffle with eagerness; he skipped towards
Gomme&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>Gomme put himself in his way:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would send it by post, please, Mr. Fosse! Good-evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse came to a halt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;a moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a pinch of Gomme&#8217;s coat-sleeve:</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;know the whole town&#8217;s as hot over this new humorist, the fellow
that wrote <i>The Tragedy of the Ridiculous</i>, as they were over Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Baddlesmere a few years ago; but, y&#8217;know, they&#8217;re overdoing it&mdash;they&#8217;re
overdoing it. There&#8217;s bound to be reaction. So I&#8217;ve just written a
scalding little thing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme&#8217;s eyes twinkled:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse tugged impatiently at his sleeve:</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;know, it doesn&#8217;t do to go with the crowd. Art is only for the
elect. The popular verdict <i>must</i> be vulgar&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll, watching from his high perch on the office-stool, raised his
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s curious, Fosse,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;for he was here only this
morning&mdash;and <i>he</i> was talking about <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse was intensely interested:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;how very interesting! May I ask what he
said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know, it was a private conversation&mdash;I don&#8217;t quite
exactly like to say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will go no farther&mdash;go no farther,&#8221; persisted Fosse, on the tip-toe
of eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he said you ought to chuck literature and try window-cleaning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood&#8217;s deep chuckle echoed about the room, and Caroline
Baddlesmere reprovingly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man&#8217;s face became scarlet; then went white. He raised
himself on his little high heels as far as his full rigidity of back and
limb and pride would take him, and, tilting his nose in the air:</p>

<p>&#8220;Puppy!&#8221; he snorted, and walked angrily out of the office.</p>

<p>Julia went and scolded Noll, who hugged her.</p>

<p>Lovegood turned to Caroline Baddlesmere, and the laughter went
out of his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caroline,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have heard rumours of the disaster impending
here&mdash;Anthony told me only this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Eustace. I&#8217;ve gone quite out of the fashion&mdash;just like yourself.
But we must not whimper when the days are black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It grieves me,&#8221; said the big man sadly.... &#8220;You are not a good
subject for the boiled potato&mdash;the homely bun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Eustace; we were all happy enough in the old Paris
days&mdash;before I made my mark with the book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eustace Lovegood&#8217;s eyes turned into the past. &#8220;Ah, the Paris
days!&#8221; said he, and fell into reverie.... &#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; he
added after awhile. &#8220;Last night, as I supped under the stars at an
itinerant barrow, regaling myself on a wondrous baked potato, a
wandering musician splitting the air with peevish song in the murk
of the London night, like some lost soul from the damned&mdash;most
dramatic situation&mdash;a note of tragedy in the blackness of the
world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His mind wandered off into his thoughts, and he stood
for awhile gazing into the night that was gone, forgetful of all that stood
about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Eustace!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s consciousness came back to his body with a start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and he took up his tale again: &#8220;A little woman in seedy clothes, a
tattered shadow, flitted out of the other shadows of the lamp-lit night,
and touched me on the arm. She wanted money.... It was the
husk&mdash;the dusty shabby husk&mdash;of little Kate Ormsby, whose singing
had some vogue a few years ago&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kate Ormsby?&mdash;who was engaged to poor drunken Andrew Blotte?&#8221;
she asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but remember, Caroline, he did not drink when he was engaged
to Kate Ormsby. Blotte was the most brilliant in promise of us all....
All <i>that</i> began when Paul Pangbutt took her away from him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;why didn&#8217;t you send her to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline suddenly flushed embarrassedly, and added with a dry
laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;I forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>She traced her confusion with her fingers on the palm of her slender
hand.</p>

<p>Lovegood went on dreamily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since Paul Pangbutt threw her over in Paris, like one of his discarded
painting-rags, she has steadily gone down hill.... She
wanted to know if I had seen Paul since he returned from his tour of
the European courts and had set up his big studio in Kensington.&#8221;
He shrugged his huge shoulders. &#8220;But I told her that the great did
not much care about associating with me&mdash;that most of those that
once knew my Christian name have forgotten even my surname.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Kate Ormsby never had imagination,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;she does not
realize how greatness crowds out the memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;She sings for money at tavern doors now,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and she was
such a dainty creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I suppose you gave her your last half-crown, Eustace!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man put out a deprecating hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;You exaggerate, Caroline; I lent her a florin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so there was no lunch to day&mdash;and will be no dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray do not exaggerate, Caroline. I wish you would not exaggerate....
I shall not regale at a restaurant&mdash;that is all.... Look at
the potentiality of satisfaction in the homely bun!... As a matter of
fact, I think the moderns eat too much flesh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut!&#8221; said Caroline Baddlesmere&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t make excuses to your
own conscience.... But you want to say something, Eustace&mdash;I
know by the way you are fiddling with other subjects. Do say it like
a good fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;the fact is&mdash;I&mdash;have&mdash;in my room&mdash;an old chippendale
writing-table. It belonged to an eighteenth-century ancestor who
wrote the most execrable verse. You remember the modest piece of
furniture?&#8221;</p>

<p>A twinkle shot into Caroline&#8217;s eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you press the question, Eustace, there <i>is</i> a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
furniture in your room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is grown somewhat shabby,&#8221; he resumed&mdash;&#8220;and a friend of
mine who has long had a great fancy for it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Caroline slyly&mdash;&#8220;what was your friend&#8217;s name, did you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes&mdash;his name is Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;I suspected it was your uncle, Eustace&mdash;his
Christian name is, I think, Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man chuckled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, now I come to think of it, his Christian name <i>is</i>
Isaac,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;He has long had a fancy for it. I called in just
now as I passed, and told him he might have it.... It will give me
more room&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;it <i>will</i> give you more room,&#8221; said Caroline dryly. &#8220;Go
on, Eustace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I detest to feel cramped. And I thought&mdash;as an
old friend&mdash;I might be permitted to suggest that&mdash;as you might want
a little loose cash on changing houses&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere stamped her foot:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am exceedingly angry with you, Eustace. You had no right to
sell an heirloom,&#8221; she said furiously. &#8220;Your room is a positive disgrace
of emptiness as it is.&#8221; She made an effort to keep her voice
steady.... &#8220;It is quite bare and homeless enough to make me
miserable every time I think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood touched her arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s done now,&#8221; he said pathetically&mdash;&#8220;and unless you take
the money I don&#8217;t quite see how I am to proceed in the matter&mdash;without
thwarting my original intention&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he added fatuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go and have the whole bargain cancelled,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Caroline; I don&#8217;t think it would be quite a proper place
for a gentlewoman to be seen in&mdash;upon my word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the pawnbroker?&#8221; she asked bluntly.</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caroline, I do not think I deserve this unkindness. He is
a collector of second-hand oddities. As a matter of fact, I only
lent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline tried to keep back the tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a ridiculous good fellow,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but you do exasperate
me.... What on earth are you going to write upon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood looked relieved:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote for an hour in bed this morning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was an
intellectual treat. I shall always compose the finer flights of my
imagination in bed in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline laughed, with a sob in the laugh, and stroked the big
fellow&#8217;s sleeve affectionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Eustace&mdash;I cannot accept it, old friend.&#8221; She dashed the
handkerchief to her eyes, and added airily: &#8220;Well, well&mdash;it&#8217;s really
very serious&mdash;I shall have to wear shabby gowns again. Hush!&#8221;</p>

<p>She signed for silence.</p>

<p>They all listened.</p>

<p>There was a shuffling footstep on the landing, and a ridiculous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
quavering attempt at a drinking song. The door was flung open and
a man, giddy with strong liquors, lurched into the room.</p>

<p>He came to an unsteady standstill, blinked at them all, and solemnly
took off his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; muttered Caroline Baddlesmere&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s Andrew
Blotte!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s poor Mr. Andrew Blotte,&#8221; said Julia in a frightened whisper
to Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mr. Blotte!&#8221; cried Noll from his high perch&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;ve just
been talking about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drunken man sniggered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk of a nightmare&mdash;and you hear it hiccup!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>But the effort at merriment upset his balance, and he made at a
rolling gait for the desk, gripped at it to steady himself, and turning
himself very carefully so as to avoid confusing his feet, he sat himself
down against the edge of it.</p>

<p>His face became a bland smile.</p>

<p>His was a splendid head. From the square brow the strong hair
sprang like a lion&#8217;s mane, and the fine massive head was set on the
shoulders in a way that gave a sense of forcefulness in the man. But
the once-handsome features were now heavy with drink, their beautiful
form was being scarred deep with harsh lines, and the hint of beauty
was only a haunting shadow of the thing that had once been. His
chin and jowls were sprinkled with a grizzled growth of beard a couple
of days old.</p>

<p>He waved his hand round the room, and brought it with a strong
masterful grip upon the desk on which he leaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he said, somewhat shame-facedly&mdash;&#8220;I
had only looked for Anthony Baddlesmere&mdash;to find out
his new address&mdash;but the fact is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He looked slowly round the
room, and his eyes lighted up as he recognised Caroline: &#8220;Ah, Caroline!&mdash;just
the person I would have wished to see. You&#8217;ll excuse me
maintaining a firm position&mdash;here&mdash;but the fact is&mdash;I&#8217;m far from
sober.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Andrew!&#8221; she said, coming to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Caroline&mdash;I&#8217;ve been watching the almonds bloom&mdash;I have
been walking on air&mdash;in realms where there is no solid, base, nor
tangible reality. Tush! And you would call me&mdash;not sober!...
Most&mdash;ridiculous&mdash;prejudice!... Why should people of taste be
sober, when by tasting what tastes well they may walk on air? Such
a strange convention!... Consider the position: You stroll down
the filthy Strand in muddied boots, all the shabby world hurrying by,
thinking sordidly of money and greynesses&mdash;or crawling along with
hunger in their eyes under the miserable gas-lamps.... Sip the
nectar of the gods, commune with Bacchus, and you are in a street of
the world of dreams&mdash;you are a-riot&mdash;you walk on the wind&mdash;the trees
are all in bloom&mdash;faces are laughing at you&mdash;the very cast-iron lamps
come to greet you&mdash;the air is full of music&mdash;you sing&mdash;everyone
sings!... Tush! you are a god.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Andrew&mdash;when vice becomes a virtue, virtue seems but a
feeble vice.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Andrew Blotte laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your trick, Caroline,&#8221; he said airily; and added, in a thick-voiced
confidential aside, glancing round the room with drunken
caution:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a confidential matter, Caroline&mdash;but&mdash;we seem to be
amongst friends. So I suppose it&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;re amongst
intimates, eh? Good! All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He whistled a refrain gallingly out of tune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew!&mdash;Andrew&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; She put her white hand on his arm.</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte patted the slender fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t go wasting shame on me, Caroline. The fact is&mdash;nobody
ever expects me to be in anything but a shameful condition.
Think what a disappointment I must be when I am sober! What
more embarrassing to a sober community than the return of the
prodigal son?&#8221;... He laughed sadly, then seriousness came back
to him. &#8220;But what I want to say is this: I hear you want money....
Well, I can lend you a loan.... I can&#8217;t get it to-day because&mdash;well,
you see, it&#8217;s rather a ridiculous position&mdash;the fact is, I&#8217;m not
quite aggressively sober&mdash;and my landlady has strict orders not to give
me any money unless I am able to count a handful of small change
without leaning for support on a physical basis.... Rather acute, I
think&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?... But I&#8217;ll make a note of it for to-morrow. I&#8217;ll tie
a knot on my handkerchief&mdash;hic&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; (He fumbled for his handkerchief
with drunken awkwardness.) &#8220;No!&mdash;<i>you</i> tie a knot on my
handkerchief.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held it out, and she took it to humour the poor fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do go and rest awhile in Anthony&#8217;s room.
There&#8217;s a comfortable armchair for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said peevishly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to rest. I&#8217;m always resting.
Andrew Blotte is tired of Andrew Blotte....&#8221; His mood suddenly
changed; a light came into his eyes: &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will promise
to rest&mdash;if you&#8217;ll promise to take my loan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline shook her head.</p>

<p>Lovegood went over to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Blotte,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t rest.... I&#8217;ve promised to take a poem
before gaslight to the editor of that new literary review&mdash;forget his
name, but his address is on one of my cuffs&mdash;somewhere....&#8221; He
chuckled, as at some reminiscence: &#8220;He said he wanted a sonnet of
two or three pages or so, but I told him it couldn&#8217;t be done&mdash;even
Will Shakespeare couldn&#8217;t do it.... But he wasn&#8217;t to be put off.&#8221;
He dug Lovegood in his tightly buttoned ribs: &#8220;He said I <i>might
choose my own subject</i>!... But I told him&mdash;hic&mdash;he must mean a
madr&#8217;gal.... We became quite friendly. For an illiterate person
he was almost poetical. He confessed he had known love. Even
editors have not always been bald. But&mdash;it is time to come and see
the almonds bloom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took Lovegood&#8217;s arm and made for the door. As they strode
out together he turned and kissed his fingers to them all.</p>

<p>Caroline followed them to the head of the stairs to see them depart.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Julia slipped anxiously across the room to Netherby Gomme:</p>

<p>&#8220;Netherby, what is this? Is it all really true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me, Netherby?&#8221; The tears sprang into
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed what I guessed, Julia; but I have only known to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they going to live?&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme smiled sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;Mrs. Baddlesmere has taken what is called by the house-agents
the <i>spacious, well-lit, and airy upper floor of an imposing
family mansion in the West End</i>.... <i>We</i> should call it an attic
in Hammersmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll, who had slid down from his office-stool, crept up to Julia:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Julia,&#8221; said he, &#8220;things seem a bit sour, don&#8217;t they?...
I suppose you and Netherby will be wanting to get married, too, and
all that sort of tomfoolery&mdash;and I had hoped to have coloured a meerschaum
pipe for him as a wedding-present. I did begin one, but it
made me so jolly sick. I have started a sailor on it now. Awfully
ripping chap! Said he didn&#8217;t mind doing it for half-a-crown if I
supplied the &#8217;baccy. He&#8217;s a terrific clever fellow&mdash;he can spit fifteen
feet! I measured it.... I was very lucky to get him&#8221;&mdash;he sighed
heavily&mdash;&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how the deuce I shall pay him for the
job now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia put her hand on Noll&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are such a sadly vulgar boy at times, Noll,&#8221; she said. She
dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you sniffing about, Julia?&#8221; he asked, knitting his brows.
&#8220;The mother has taken a jolly nice top-floor, <i>I</i> can tell you. One of
the rooms is whopping big. We are going to do our own cooking&mdash;on
such a rummy little stove. It&#8217;ll be a tremendous lark, won&#8217;t it?
Roof slopes like a hen-roost.... I once poached an egg in the lid
of a biscuit-tin over two candles&mdash;Jeroosalem! it <i>did</i> take a time&mdash;but
it <i>was</i> an egg&mdash;it never quite got out of the wollopy condition, I
don&#8217;t know why&mdash;and it burst half-way through the business&mdash;I think
I kept jogging it up too often with a pencil to see if it were stiffening.
But it was the most eggy egg I ever tasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia laughed lightly to smother a sob:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a ridiculous boy, Noll,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Noll held her out at arms&#8217; length and looked at her keenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you sniffing about, Julia? Anyone been annoying you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline had stolen back to the room. She walked over to Julia
and put her hand on her shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Julia,&#8221; she said gently&mdash;&#8220;no one will be any the worse
for it. It&#8217;s always darkest before the dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the boy Noll, straddling his legs and peering
at the coming years&mdash;&#8220;every great man begins in an attic.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it would appear that the most respectable Stucco Architecture
may be but a Screen for Gnawing Secrets</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boy Noll shut the door that gave on to the narrow landing from
the two large attics which were now his home, pushed back the silk
hat on his head, and thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets,
and whistling an air, he glanced up at the skylight above him to see
whether the weather held.</p>

<p>He tramped slowly down a few steps of the top flight of carpetless
stairs that proclaim the attic heights, and halted aimlessly.</p>

<p>It was more than vaguely borne in upon him that a great change had
come over his life since, a month ago, he had taken down his prints
from the walls of his empty home, and, with them tucked in a bundle
under his arm, had walked into the twilight, trudging it on foot after
the cart that contained the few pieces of furniture and such belongings
as had not been sold, and, at the solemn journey&#8217;s end, skipping up
three or four whitened steps, had entered the doors of this stucco well-to-do
house that was let in apartments, standing, one of a row of like
houses, glued together along the length of a long winding street&mdash;a
&#8220;street with a good address,&#8221; the advertisement had it.</p>

<p>The cushioned and unthinking ease of childhood was gone, buried
in that empty house he had left behind him&mdash;the door was shut on
that for ever. The rougher, hardier period of boyhood was upon
him.</p>

<p>It now came to the boy, who had never even wondered where everything
came from, that each such everything had always had to be won
by the sweat of toil. He had wondered more than once why that for
which he had asked had sometimes been refused. But he now realized
that the lucky-bag from which childhood gets all it wants was empty&mdash;sold
at a tap of the hammer with the other things in that dead house,
by an auctioneer fellow&mdash;gone&mdash;vanished.</p>

<p>He tramped down some half-dozen bare board steps that resounded
to his boots, and halted again.</p>

<p>He was beginning to see that the fuel of life was not to be had for
the asking. His mother sitting the livelong day and far into the night
in that big attic he had just left&mdash;the one with his little bed in the
corner of it, the large room that served as general sitting-room by day,
his bed with coloured covering becoming in the daylight a couch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
therein&mdash;his mother sitting there writing, with absent eyes fixed on her
distant purpose, brought into hard reality the harder fact that money
had to be earned&mdash;that it did not come from Somewhere for the
beckoning. His father&#8217;s long absences, and his boots muddied with
long trudges, were significant and unspoken about, hinting of mysteries
he could not wholly fathom&mdash;nor was the serious gaze of the
handsome face as his father sat at night and stared at the stove less
troubling to the boy.</p>

<p>He tramped down another step or two.</p>

<p>It bothered him that he could not help. He knew he must grow
into youth before his hand could win this wage that all the world was
hurrying after.</p>

<p>He tramped down a few more steps.</p>

<p>For one thing he felt glad. He had thought it a bore when his
mother had made out a scheme of reading for him, making him give
his morning and a couple of hours of the afternoon to a course of
English literature and history, and a promise to keep up his mathematics;
but, as a matter of fact, and to his intense surprise, he was
enjoying it.</p>

<p>He tramped down a couple of steps.</p>

<p>It was so like the mother to have clung to her books when she sold
even her silks and satins!</p>

<p>He tramped down another step.</p>

<p>He wondered why there was no carpet to the attic flight. He wondered
who lived in the rooms on each of these four landings below.
That Major Modeyne, who lived on this one below them, seemed such
a pleasant old fellow&mdash;it was a great pity he came in so late and so
often the worse for liquor.... But he was mighty funny over it. He
wondered if he felt as funny as he looked. It seemed such an odd
thing to fill one&#8217;s self with strong liquors until one glugged hiccuping
and ran over!</p>

<p>He tramped down several steps.</p>

<p>The boy had always thought of himself as being a part of a
vague body of people called gentlefolk&mdash;a people who were always
provided for from some gentlemanly source of livelihood which
demanded clean hands and a sense of duty and no manual labour
or a shop, quite a species apart from the mere middle-class world,
and for whom the working classes provided the comforts of life,
cleaning their boots and doing them service. Tradesmen and the
labouring class, of course, were bound to earn a livelihood&mdash;a thing
which he had always felt, without being expressly told so, to be rather
a vulgar thing to do; although, of course, it was a very good thing for
that sort of people.</p>

<p>As he reached the bottom of the uncarpeted stair, and was about to
step on to the drugget of the landing, a door opened, and there came
out on to the landing a child of about twelve.</p>

<p>She shook back the nut-brown hair from her clear grey eyes and
gazed defiantly at Noll:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fool!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Noll took off his hat, sat down on the bottom step, put his chin in his
hands, and gazed at her:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re very pretty,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you were an impudent fool,&#8221; she said hotly&mdash;&#8220;I meant
a common, vulgar tomfool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded.</p>

<p>The dainty slender girl before him gazed at him sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you that put all the water-cans about the landing, and
the water-jugs on the stairs, for my father to fall amongst when&#8221;&mdash;she
hesitated and flushed angrily&mdash;&#8220;when he came back late last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;and he fell amongst them.&#8221; He chuckled. &#8220;I
watched him over the rail. It was moonlight up here. He came
crawling up the stairs in the dark, saying Shush! to himself if a
board creaked, and carrying his boots in his hand so as not to wake
the landlady&mdash;and when he got on to this landing he gave a monstrous
hiccup that jolly nearly pulled him off his feet, and he tripped up
amongst the cans&mdash;away went his boots, and fell in the hall below.
D&#8217;you know, I shall never play a lark on your father again&mdash;he&#8217;s such
a gentleman. Most people would have sworn themselves putrid, but
he just rubbed his shins and elbows, sat up in the moonlight, and
said with a hiccup: &#8216;<i>What a prodigious number of stars there
are at the north pole! Shakespeare has cracked every nut&mdash;when
beggars die, says he, there are no comets seen, the heavens themselves
blaze forth the fall of the landed gentry.... I did not know
all heaven held so many, various, multitudinous, and vast prodigious
stars!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl waited grimly until he had done:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you who made a booby-trap in his bed so that he could not
get into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;he looked jolly comic under the bed; he got
under&mdash;he must have slept there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just where you are mistaken,&#8221; said the child with a sneer.
&#8220;I never go to bed until my father is asleep. I got him out.... I
suppose you thought you were funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I did, last night. But I don&#8217;t now. I think I
was a cad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; she said....</p>

<p>Noll sat for awhile and gazed at her.</p>

<p>He got up and held out his hand sheepishly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake hands,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I apologize. It&#8217;s my birthday to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty considered.</p>

<p>She hesitated&mdash;then put out a delicate thin hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;What age are you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen,&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be twelve to-morrow,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s keep it now,&#8221; said Noll. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see a splendid
fellow, a friend of mine&mdash;he&#8217;s a prodigious clever fellow&mdash;he&#8217;s written
a book.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>The child&#8217;s eyes glittered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, rather. Come and see him too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but come in and have tea first, and
I&#8217;ll put on my hat and jacket. We shan&#8217;t be very late out, shall
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring you back the moment you like,&#8221; said Noll. &#8220;We only
have high tea in the evenings now, so my people don&#8217;t mind my being
late to an hour or so; they know I&#8217;m with Netherby. But we&#8217;ll be
back sharp, and you can come to tea with us, eh? I&#8217;d like to introduce
you to my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child nodded, and led the way into the Major&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>Noll, with the boy&#8217;s quick vision, took in a first picture of the little
lady&#8217;s surroundings that never left him.</p>

<p>It was a large and airy room, furnished within the absolute limits of
necessity. In a corner by a door stood the child&#8217;s little white bed, but
it required more imagination than was given to the ordinary to call up
the image of a small child that stood every night listening at that
other door to hear whether her father&#8217;s breathing were heavy enough
for sleep; to call up the vision of the slight figure that nightly opened
that same door with stealthy care to make sure of the candle being
out, and all danger of fire set far from the reach of awkward drunken
hands; it demanded a keener ear than his to hear the last sigh of the
child as she slipped into her bed in the small hours of the night and
lay down to take her long-delayed rest in that sleep that should have
sealed her eyes for hours, and had already held the rest of the world
for a half of the night.</p>

<p>The dainty little figure that now stood before the mirror, giving to
her hat just that touch which makes or mars the adornment of women,
showed no peevish rebellion against, nor carping discontent with, the
sordid burden of life that had been thrust upon her far too young and
sadly thin little shoulders. She might indeed have gone, as she stood,
to Court, and withal taught the ladies of fashion there assembled more
than something of the queenly attitude.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the child it was that took the sense of emptiness
from the empty room. The little table that stood before the fireplace,
with a napkin spread upon it for tablecloth&mdash;it had been washed by
her small hands&mdash;and the coarse tea-things set out upon it: these things
and the kettle that bubbled on the hob had quite evidently been
deserted by the child when she marched out to her attack in the
passage.</p>

<p>Noll now proceeded to make the tea at her bidding&mdash;she giving him
orders as she gazed into the mirror, in which she commanded a view
of the room.</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes wandered over the walls, which were bare enough to
bring his quick attention to rest on the picture of a man in uniform
that hungover the mantel&mdash;the picture of handsome Cornelius Mauduit
Modeyne as he had been when he married the mild beauty with the
tragic eyes that dreamed out of the picture hanging pendant to his,
and to whom the child bore more than a little likeness. Had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pictures been inspired with the history of these lives, they would have
revealed the early death of the brooding beauty in the birth of the
small child whose hands were now the only hands that tended these
two miniatures with the caressing touch of affection&mdash;the man&#8217;s picture
would have continued the confidence, and told of handsome Corney
Modeyne&#8217;s seeking relief from loneliness in the mad lees of the bottle&mdash;it
would have whispered, too, of the meeting of his old comrades in
his room to tell him he must slip quietly out of his old regiment&mdash;of
his retirement with a step of rank&mdash;of the two years of his living upon
his relations until they grew first weary, then exasperated, then hostile
towards him, and the always rather silent child that flushed at all their
harsh thrusts at her easy-going father&mdash;and of his final collapse as
that mysterious personage who is an urgent daily &#8220;something in the
city.&#8221; It would have revealed what was hidden even from the buzzing
gossips of the Street with the Good Address&mdash;that Major Cornelius
Mauduit Modeyne, when he sallied out at the breakfast hour with a
swaggering air, in well-groomed attire, polished boots, and shining hat,
as soon as he could be got out of bed by the silent child who guarded
all his secrets that could be hid, owed his good care to those self-same
small hands. As it would also have revealed that, in spite of all
shame, the dainty hands that did these things and had these cares,
touched everything that had to do with this foolish sinning man with a
fierce affection.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is more in noble tradition than in blood. The battle-cry
of the ancient Modeynes had been Loyalty.</p>

<p>Modeyne came of old aristocratic Catholic stock, but he had long
ceased to attend his church; and the image, a very beautiful image of
the Mary and Child, that stood upon his mantel was the sole relic of
his old beliefs&mdash;even it did not stand there from any vague sentiment
towards his church; indeed, it had not gone to the pawnbroker as
much from negligence as from religious bias.</p>

<p>The child would sing to herself at times the beautiful lines of
the <i>Ave Maria</i> that Gounod has set to Bach&#8217;s Fugue, just as
she would lilt a nursery rhyme; but the learning of it was an
early reminiscence of her father in his cups, moved to song. Her
prayers, on going to bed at night, were just a part of her duty
in putting off her clothes&mdash;it warmed and coloured the child&#8217;s
imagination, was the full stop to her day, but it was quite aloof
from the conduct of the world. From Modeyne the child had inherited
remarkable charm of manner as well as much of her dainty
delicacy....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hat and jacket being arranged to her taste, the child went and
sat down beside Noll, and presided over the hospitalities. She
apologized for the thickness of the bread and butter, but she said it
was her last meal of the day, and she was always hungry for it. She
remembered she had some cake, and tripped off to the cupboard; but
her face fell when she took the fragment out of its carefully enwrapping
silver-paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got it nearly a month ago&mdash;for my father&#8217;s birthday,&#8221; she said
simply. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s gone dry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&#8220;I like it all rubbly best,&#8221; said Noll&mdash;&#8220;it tastes so nutty.&#8221; He
deceived the child into a smile. In any case he was in the caterpillar
stage of youth.</p>

<p>They ate it between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> rather nutty,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I never noticed that before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Childhood takes the world for granted.</p>

<p>As the two went cheerily down the stairs and out into the street, the
boy&#8217;s heart lightened; the gnawing sense of loneliness that had
oppressed him fell from him, and the stucco street turned to a way of
palaces in the grey of the twilight.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Miss Betty Modeyne is introduced to the Study of Nature</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> they stood on the doorstep, waiting for the answer to their ring at
Netherby Gomme&#8217;s bell, Betty broke a pensive silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never spoken to an author,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She had not imagined the spring of literature as running in so dingy
a well.</p>

<p>Noll pshawed airily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known a lot,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They&#8217;re just like everybody else,
except when they think they are not&mdash;and then they are beastly
tedious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door was opened by the grim old lady who was mother to
Netherby Gomme. Her, Noll saluted cheerily. The old lady shook
hands with him and darted a jealous look at the girl.</p>

<p>Noll explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought a friend of mine,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Miss Betty Modeyne.&#8221;
The old lady bowed stiffly to the child.</p>

<p>Noll took off his hat:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Netherby is in?&#8221; he said, calmly walking into the
passage; and the child followed him.</p>

<p>The old lady shut the outer door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;he&#8217;s about finished work by this, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you trouble to come up, Mrs. Gomme,&#8221; said Noll airily,
opening the sitting-room door with elaborate formality for the old
lady; &#8220;I know the way up, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled. The light suddenly snapped out of her shrewd eyes
again&mdash;she glanced sharply at the girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said she, &#8220;the little lady will remain with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no; she wants to see a great writer in his workshop,&#8221; he said;
and the jealousy went out of the old lady&#8217;s eyes. She nodded and
smiled as she withdrew to her chair by the fire.</p>

<p>The youngsters made a move for the heights.</p>

<p>Noll, when he had shut the old lady&#8217;s door, said to Betty in a
whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her bedroom at the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>They mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;She lets the other floors,&#8221; added Noll, as they passed shut doors.
&#8220;Netherby&#8217;s room is right at the top....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Netherby Gomme made his visitors welcome. The talk was soon
rattling at a pace.</p>

<p>He suddenly missed from her place the dainty little figure, and,
looking up, he found that she was making a round of the attic, his
beloved workshop. The child had slipped off to peer at the prints
which hung tacked on to the walls on squares of stiff brown paper&mdash;the
overflow from Noll&#8217;s collection. They added a delightful touch of
beauty to the dingy place, and were in splendid sombre harmony with
the books, themselves amongst the most decorative of all ornaments&mdash;which
here held possession of every nook and cranny, and overflowed
every shelf.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme went and lit a candle, holding it for her that she
might see the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that say to you?&#8221; he asked the solemn child. She was
gazing intently at Timothy Cole&#8217;s exquisite wood engraving of Millet&#8217;s
&#8220;Sower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It says&mdash;no, it <i>sings</i> to me,&#8221; she said, trying with deliberate
searching to find the absolute word, as a young thrush tries its notes;
and the effort of her intellect to express the right hair&#8217;s-breadth value
touched Gomme&#8217;s instincts and made the art leap within him. He
nodded. The child faced the picture, and went on haltingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It sings to me of&mdash;&mdash; It is a man walking in a furrow&mdash;and all the
earth seems to be whispering&mdash;in a sort of hush&mdash;as if live things were
coming out of the silence. Twilight is far more full of spirits than any
other time&mdash;things that beckon and tell secrets. The dusk is always
filled with whispers, as if sweet young things were being born, and
poor dying things were glad to be going to sleep.... That&#8217;s the
sower&mdash;he walks along and sows. And he is solemn, because he
knows that all that he flings on the dark earth will spring in the dusk,
and become alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby stroked her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, &#8220;do you think the artist who painted that picture
meant you to feel all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; she asked simply. She looked at it again with serious
grey eyes. She shook her head doggedly. &#8220;No; that isn&#8217;t just a
man in a field. Sometimes pictures look as if they had been
painted just because the painter wanted to show how cleverly he
could draw an eye or an ear or a bootlace; but, look! this sower has
not got any of these things, yet somehow they are there&mdash;they seem
to come in as one looks. The sowing in the twilight is the thing.
I can hear the big clumsy man walking with long strides, his heavy
footfall all muffled in the brown earth. I can see it and hear it and
smell it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The child ceased speaking, at a loss to explain, her little brows knit
as she stood searching for expression.</p>

<p>The boy Noll stood at gaze, wondering.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme said not a word.</p>

<p>The girl sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it say that to you?&#8221; she asked, looking up at the big
awkward fellow, whose intent face, lit by the candle-light, showed
large eyes fixed on some distant thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>He came back to earth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Betty,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;something like that. That is one of the
world&#8217;s masterpieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Masterpiece.&#8221; The child repeated the word lovingly&mdash;&#8220;I like
that word&mdash;masterpiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the next print. It was the wondrous little wood-engraving of
the vision as seen by the youthful Holman Hunt of The
Lady of Shalott when the mirror cracks from side to side and the web
on the loom flies wide, for her eyes have seen unheeding Lancelot.</p>

<p>The child looked at it for a long while:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what that means,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;the lady has been
weaving something, and it has all got tangled about her, and she can&#8217;t
undo the knots.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so hard to undo the knots,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard the ballad of <i>The Lady of Shalott</i>, Betty?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>The child shook her dainty head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down in a cosy chair and I&#8217;ll read it to you,&#8221; he said. And he
set his armchair for her, seating himself by his lamp.</p>

<p>He took up a battered, dog-eared volume of Tennyson and read the
immortal ballad, and Betty, to the haunting music of the verse, strayed
into the meads by Camelot, and, lingering by the river&#8217;s brink, she
listened with the awed reapers amongst the bearded barley, watching
the heavy barges glide by until there came wending past that most
tragic barge of all that floated down to the hushed death-song of the
broken-hearted faery Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme closed the book gently, and watched the child.</p>

<p>Her eyes were full of tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but why did she die?&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She loved what could not give her love,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The child nodded her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The child sat silent for a long while. Then she took the lighted
candle and went and peered at the little design. She came back
to the table, and put down the candle upon it:</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the way that lady&#8217;s head is placed right up against the top
of the picture,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;as if she felt something were crushing
her down....&#8221; She put her small hands on her dainty head&mdash;&#8220;crushing
and crushing her down&mdash;and she can&#8217;t get away from it,
because&mdash;it&#8217;s all tangled&mdash;tangled&mdash;tangled. And it won&#8217;t come
right.... It always feels just like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said Netherby Gomme hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;has this child
begun to suffer already?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child went to his knee and gazed at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes are full of tears,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He blew his nose noisily:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not take my tears too seriously, Betty,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I am
a humorist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;No, no, Betty&mdash;no misters, please, between us here&mdash;plain
Netherby,&#8221; he corrected her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Netherby,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;I thought everyone had known
suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank God,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only women?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;it isn&#8217;t a matter of man or woman. Only God&#8217;s aristocracy
are crucified,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only a few suffer so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked into the beyond; a smile ran round the serious little
lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> glad to hear that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>And she added after a while:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall sleep better now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby turned in his chair and looked at the child solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, little woman,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She came to him, with her light walk, a dainty lank child, wrought
of the finest fibre.</p>

<p>Me held out his two hands, and she put a slender little hand in
each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;who have you heard say these things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; she said simply&mdash;&#8220;I just feel them so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby stroked her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;One of these days, Betty, the world will listen to you. But don&#8217;t
trouble about things until you are grown up&mdash;just enjoy your life now.
Noll, Betty is too much indoors. She must get out into the fresh
air of the world&mdash;she must study nature&mdash;we must take her to the
theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s eyes sparkled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been to a theatre,&#8221; she said, her nerves dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go to a pit to-morrow night, Noll, eh? all three of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Betty and Noll with Netherby descended the stairs, the door
of the old lady&#8217;s sitting-room was open.</p>

<p>Betty turned and walked in&mdash;stepped lightly to the side of the old
woman where she sat before the fire in her armchair, her old watchful
eyes fixed on the open door, and the child leaned forward and kissed
her withered old cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because you love Netherby; and you have
his big kind eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady put out her old hand and stroked the child&#8217;s head:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are leaving Master Noll sadly out in the cold, my little
lady,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Betty turned and looked at Noll:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;I love him in quite a different way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady laughed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning being Betty&#8217;s birthday, she found at her door
a sheet of stiff brown paper on which was fixed the print of &#8220;The
Sower,&#8221; the whole set in a battered old picture-frame of Noll&#8217;s. It
was the first birthday gift she had ever had&mdash;as long as she could
remember....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>The evening of her twelfth birthday Betty spent in the pit of a
theatre.</p>

<p>The sound of the rushing feet of the theatre-goers passing eagerly
into the pit in holiday humour; the rustle of silk and satin and the
leisurely entrance of handsomely dressed women into the more
gorgeous comfort of the stalls as they dawdled to their elaborate
seats; the delicious tunings of violins as the bandsmen took their
places in the orchestra; the burst of music; the echo of the stage
carpenter&#8217;s hammer from the screened world hidden by the great
curtain beyond the footlights; the lowering of lights and resulting
sudden darkness in the theatre; the sharp clink of a bell for the ringing
up of the curtain; the hushing into silence of the whispering
audience; the slow uprolling of the great curtain as it was gathered
into the flies; and the footlights disclosed another world, flinging its
large picture upon the vision&mdash;the fantastic reality of the drama&mdash;a
world that comes to life for a little while and holds the imagination as
it were held by a dream.</p>

<p>So the child sat, between Noll and Netherby, holding a hand of
each. It struck her keen wits as strange that in the large drawing-rooms
of her fashionable relations she had felt no warmth of
affection towards the glittering women who turned their cold critical
eyes upon this child of their ne&#8217;er-do-weel soldier kinsman&mdash;yet here
were two lads, whom she had not known a couple of days ago, winning
her confidence by their large chivalry, their whole-souled friendship
now grown as old as her life&mdash;friendship such as makes of life a
splendid adventure.</p>

<p>When the curtain came down on the last act, the child sighed.
She realized with a pang that the play was over.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is hinted that to be Famous is not necessarily to be Great</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a large and richly furnished studio that was the splendid workshop
of a fashionable portrait-painter there stood before an easel a handsome
fair-bearded man&mdash;handsome, though the head was small&mdash;a
fellow who held himself with self-reliance, straight and satisfied.
And with the calculated stroke of one who has mastered the technique
of his craft, he set down the loaded brush on the embrowned canvas,
yielding a touch of colour that told like living flesh on the portrait of
the pretty woman whose likeness he was building up into life.</p>

<p>The stroke of colour pleased him, and he stood back and peered at
it. He turned his head and glanced keenly at the pretty woman where
she sat in the handsome chair that stood on the painter&#8217;s throne before
him, her beauty enhanced and brought out by the carefully arranged
crimson draping that was set in the grand manner as a heavy curtain
looped behind her with golden cords and tassel&mdash;indeed, she made a
telling picture as she sat there framed in by the great screen that
was placed at her left hand to keep away the draught from the large
double doors near by.</p>

<p>The beauty of Lady Persimmon, as the world knows, had caught
roving royal eyes; and she was at the height of her vogue, gathering
from this strange source of public esteem such homage as is given to
the toy of a court. She was, in very truth, exquisite as a butterfly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said she with languid, lazy accent that caressed the words she
uttered, &#8220;I should love to live in Bohemia.&#8221; And she added with a
pout: &#8220;Society is such a weary round&mdash;and so spiteful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul Pangbutt shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;A part of the price you must pay for being a beautiful woman, my
dear lady,&#8221; he said&mdash;and he went back to his painting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Spite!&#8221; she asked, the handsome brows meeting in
questioning furrows. Her lips were very red&mdash;<i>half open with delicious
whisperings of scarlet sin</i>, a minor poet had it&mdash;so she would keep
them half open, though she most pronouncedly estranged herself from
the minor poet for close upon a fortnight in display of her deep resentment.
Thus, too, she was now being limned.</p>

<p>Pangbutt painted the corner of her pathetic mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Spite is the unwitting tribute of a petty mind,&#8221; he pronounced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that is any excuse for it,&#8221; she said smartly.</p>

<p>Pangbutt stood back; and he uttered a light laugh:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;The world is one vast engine of criticism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A man is
not a critic because he writes for a newspaper. That act is generally
the mark of his incapacity. We are all discriminators. Bless my
soul&mdash;<i>conversation</i> is criticism more than half the time! And why
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather alarming, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she cooed. &#8220;Fancy if we criticised
our friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly what you do!&#8221; he pshawed. &#8220;You give your friendship:
it is criticism in action. On others you turn a cold shoulder. You
have said no word&mdash;but you have passed criticism. You have&mdash;well!&mdash;you
have turned a very pretty but cruel back&mdash;uttered a more brutal
verdict than tongue ever spoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a charming colourist, Paul&mdash;but all your craft cannot whitewash
spite,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I only say that criticism has its shabby side.
Spite is criticism gone sour.... But, tsha! I don&#8217;t believe there is
all this venom in the world.&#8221; He laid down his palette: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very
comfortable old world.... I&#8217;m afraid the light has gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed the easel aside, and came to where she sat. He set a
foot on the throne, and leaned his elbow upon his knee, gazing into
her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;The light has gone, and your great beauty calls for all the light&mdash;it
dares the sun&#8217;s severest cross-examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand and she placed her slender fingers in his; she
felt his admiring regard upon her. He pressed her fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are firing my art as it has never been fired&mdash;you have given
my craft all that it has lacked&mdash;yet your beauty, that exquisite thing
over which you have no control, which is of no willing of yours, not
even your own gift to yourself, is so subtle, so elusive, so wonderful,
that all the colours of my art, all my knowledge of their use, cannot
give more than a hint of that which you have, and without the asking.
You are the living thing&mdash;I can at best but paint some poor suggestion
of it. And when I have done, what is there in all my effort of the
warmth and the sweetness, of the mystic fragrance of you?...
Yet&#8221;&mdash;he played with her fingers&mdash;&#8220;yet,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you are giving
me that inspiration that will set me above my fellows&mdash;the artist has
never been anything of moment until fired by the flame of a great
passion&mdash;and it may be that your beauty will make my art to glow and
live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if I&mdash;have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated prettily, and he kissed her fingers.</p>

<p>She was really thinking that this was a doing of the thing handsomely,
but young Nick Bellenden of the Guards talked less and made
of loving a more exciting affair. After all, the embrace was chief part
of the business&mdash;not this dandified talk.</p>

<p>Thus they played at half-revealed travesties of passion; she keeping
back much she would not have had him guess; he himself, perhaps,
only half-realizing how little he allowed her glamour to interfere with
his art until the light was gone and his craft at rest. The man had
not even the excuse of jumping blood, the plea of hot-headedness. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
never allowed his intrigues to interfere with his self-ordained task of
setting a crown of contemporary fame upon his achievement....</p>

<p>It was dusk when he said inquiringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have some tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rang the bell.</p>

<p>She laughed gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not turned on the light,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He snapped the trigger of the electric switch, and the room burst
into light.</p>

<p>An old man-servant flung open the door and entered, bearing a
glittering tea-service on a silver salver. As he came into view round
the edge of the high screen, Pangbutt beckoned him towards the
throne:</p>

<p>&#8220;Set the tray by her ladyship, Dukes,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The old butler set down the things on the throne at her feet.</p>

<p>Lady Persimmon lolled back in her chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I should love, just for a little while,
to live in Bohemia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt laughed. It had been borne in upon him that this gentle
beauty had deft resource and a somewhat confirmed habit in steering
awkward corners. He came back to argument:</p>

<p>&#8220;But Bohemia, too, has its shabby side,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;there is spite
even in Bohemia.... I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m watering down some of your
illusions, Lady Persimmon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s quite easy to see that <i>you</i> were not long in Bohemia&mdash;not
long enough to be infected with its home-sickness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler passed stealthily out of the room on silent feet&mdash;and the
catch on the door faintly clicked.</p>

<p>The pretty woman nestled back amongst her cushions, and gazed
through half-closed lids with languorous eyes at the man who poured
out the tea near her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so pleasant,&#8221; she said with a comfortable sigh, &#8220;to see the tea&mdash;the
silver&mdash;the china. The fragrance of it all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, the silver teapot in his hand, and smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are no footmen in Bohemia&mdash;very little silver&mdash;very
indifferent china.&#8221; He handed her a cup of tea. &#8220;They live as often
as not upon imagination&mdash;and mad cow is their chiefest dish.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised inquiring eyebrows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad cow?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunger,&#8221; said he, and he laughed.... &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound an
alluring dish, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; she purred, and sipped tea. &#8220;Still&#8221;&mdash;she sighed&mdash;&#8220;it
must be rather exciting. It must be so romantic&mdash;to starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an age of romance, then,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She sighed, prattling on:</p>

<p>&#8220;And it must be delicious to be famous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flattery sent a smirk to Pangbutt&#8217;s lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Fame&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The handle of the door moved, clicking in its turning, and Pangbutt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
looking over his shoulder, where he stood by the edge of the great
screen, saw the door open, and a haggard face look in. The intruder
came into the room a step or so.</p>

<p>Pangbutt gasped with frank surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthony? Good God, where have you sprung from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to come before the light has quite gone, Paul; but I&#8217;m
starving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Starving?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony nodded his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m! There you have the real devil in the machinery&mdash;and
I&#8217;m turning on the lime-light of confession.&#8221; He glanced round the
great studio deliberately: &#8220;This is rather a handsome room to confess
in&mdash;a palace to our rooms in the old Paris days, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt was cudgelling his wits to say something that would
discover the presence of the seated lady behind the screen to the
careless intruder, when Anthony strode up to him; and as the corner
of the throne came into his range of vision beyond the end of the
screen, he caught sight of the tray with the bright tea-things upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Food, ye gods!&#8221; he cried, and strode towards the tray. &#8220;Paul,&#8221;
he said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;I must have food.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand to the tray&mdash;halted&mdash;hesitated&mdash;stood up
and took off his hat, as, on passing the screen, the enthroned sitter
came into his view.</p>

<p>He bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I apologize for my want of manners. The
truth is I pawned them weeks ago&mdash;with my waistcoat and the last
family portrait&mdash;a miniature of my uncle the general&mdash;a most polished
person, who would have died of an apoplectic fit to see himself
coming to move in such mixed company&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt coughed; and mumbling their names, as the fashion is,
he introduced them, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of mine&mdash;from Bohemia.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes laughed to her. He turned to Anthony as the two bowed
to each other formally:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;the sight of you takes me back to Paris&mdash;and
makeshifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Makeshifts!&#8221; Anthony laughed sadly, and, rousing, added&mdash;&#8220;I
say, Paul, have you finished with the crumbs on that tray?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt uttered an embarrassed laugh, and went and rang the
bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthony was always impatient for the dinner-hour,&#8221; he said&mdash;and
turning to Dukes as he appeared at the door he added&mdash;&#8220;Take away
the tray, Dukes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony put out his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&mdash;couldn&#8217;t he&mdash;leave the tray? I see some crumbs....
Bring another tray, Dukes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt signed to the old butler to wait:</p>

<p>&#8220;A glass of wine, Anthony?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsah! you don&#8217;t understand, Paul. I&#8217;m not playing with my
vitals&mdash;I&#8217;m starving, man,&#8221; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chicken?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;The man&#8217;s a god!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you mind it cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, Paul! I shall die in the midst of all these elaborate
courtesies&mdash;this rigid etiquette!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sank down wearily upon a corner of the painting throne, and
fidgeted with the tea-things on the tray.</p>

<p>Pangbutt gave an embarrassed laugh, and turned to the butler:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dukes, bring up a tray&mdash;cold chicken&mdash;wine&mdash;anything you can
get. Quick as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221; said Dukes, and formally disappeared.</p>

<p>The beauty had been markedly uneasy; she now rose to take her
leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be running away, Mr. Pangbutt,&#8221; she said; and bowing
over her shoulder to Anthony, who rose and returned her bow with stiff
precision as she stepped lightly down from the throne: &#8220;So sorry!&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>As Pangbutt moved with her through the door she asked him in
confidential undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the savage? Where does he come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bohemia,&#8221; he said, with a dry mocking smile; and he lingered
about her on the landing, to assist her with her cloak. He escorted
her downstairs to her carriage....</p>

<p>When they were gone from the studio, Anthony Baddlesmere rose
from his seat, carrying the last piece of a tea-cake in his hand, and,
walking over to the easel, as he ate the cake he regarded the picture
with critical eye:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t bad!&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>Pangbutt entered the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>He laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Her ladyship doesn&#8217;t seem to be so enamoured of Bohemia after
all,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; asked Anthony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing,&#8221; said Pangbutt. &#8220;I am afraid we have
spoilt a pretty woman&#8217;s illusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony gazed at the canvas before him:</p>

<p>&#8220;To destroy a pretty woman&#8217;s illusions is cruel as plucking out a
child&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; he said, and added: &#8220;Who&#8217;s the doll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Persimmon; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Eleanor Persimmon, who married old Gilders Persimmon?...
He dyed his beard for the wedding&mdash;naughty old
man&mdash;and he&#8217;s had to renew it ever since&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt went to the fireplace, and he turned and said severely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Gilders Persimmon is not in his youth, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Paul&mdash;I&#8217;m not blaming him for being a ruin&mdash;but he&#8217;s so
damned badly restored.&#8221; He turned to the picture. &#8220;So you are
Eleanor Persimmon, my lady!&#8221; He gazed at the portrait dreamily;
and, suddenly rousing, added: &#8220;Not much of a likeness, old boy,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt smiled wryly.</p>

<p>Anthony peered round the easel at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she babbles all the time!&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Pangbutt stiffened before the fire:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Persimmon is a most charming woman,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; it&#8217;s in the family,&#8221; Anthony said airily&mdash;&#8220;she&#8217;s a sort of
cousin of mine. My brother had rather a calf-love for her&mdash;when he
was seventeen&mdash;and a calf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt flushed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care to discuss Lady Persimmon,&#8221; he said stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I can quite understand that,&#8221; said Anthony breezily.
&#8220;Nor do I&mdash;nor do I. She was always rather uninteresting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked over to the throne: &#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; thought he. &#8220;H&#8217;m!
ha! Paul still worships the titled classes. He was always weak in
the first commandment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down wearily and searched aimlessly under the little covers
of the cake-dishes on the tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I exaggerated when I said there were crumbs....&#8221;
And he added with a laugh&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose cousin Eleanor
recognised cousin Anthony&mdash;I was only sixteen&mdash;besides, she would
not be prepared for his rising at her pretty feet like a down-at-heels
pantomime clown in this Palace of Art&mdash;this lofty pleasure-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong Lady Persimmon by insinuation,&#8221; said Pangbutt sulkily&mdash;&#8220;she
is a woman of most generous sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony uttered a funny little laughing grunt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Eleanor was always the soul of sentiment and&mdash;delicate
self-indulgence. She used to adore the portrait of Shelley&mdash;weep over
Chatterton&mdash;cry over Kit Marlowe&mdash;and&mdash;married a baronet in an
advanced state of decay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up, strode to the easel again, and examined the picture.
Pangbutt watched him under his brows with sulky attention, lolling
against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Paul, old boy,&#8221; Anthony said at last&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been sketching
the doll&#8217;s soul for you; but you&#8217;ve got none of <i>that</i> into her picture....
The colour and technique may be all there&mdash;and it is splendidly
handled&mdash;<i>but where&#8217;s the woman?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony&#8217;s frank criticism, his just and keen appreciation of the good
and the weak side of a work of art, had always won Pangbutt&#8217;s admiration;
and the scowl left his eyes now as the praise bit into his conceit.
The detraction passed by him:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, Anthony,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;sometimes I suspect I am too
successful&mdash;too easily successful&mdash;and I have a horror of becoming
commonplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes followed the other as he slouched carelessly back to the
throne and flung himself upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Nonsense, Paul.&#8221; He searched aimlessly amongst the
empty plates again: &#8220;That&#8217;s all cant. Look at <i>me</i>. I&#8217;m as empty as
a bubble&mdash;but it&#8217;s just as difficult to write sparkling prose on an empty
stomach as to be a poetic alderman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt gazed down at his own shining boots complacently:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not forgotten what personal discomfort was, in the old
Paris days. I detested it. I determined from the first to be rid of
it.... Where are you living?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>The man that sat on the throne shrugged his shoulders, gazing at
vacancy sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;In a very shabby corner of Bohemia, Paul, where, in the streets,
every vagrant wind makes whirlpools of stray papers&mdash;that shuffle by&mdash;like
the damned restless whispering ghosts of rejected poems&mdash;or
other stammerings that are the inky outpourings of broken literary
careers.... Not at all the sort of place that you would like, old
boy.... But, Paul&#8221;&mdash;he looked round the room&mdash;&#8220;you muttered
something&mdash;about&mdash;a chicken&mdash;just now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul laughed&mdash;a little embarrassedly; and rang the bell:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d like to take off your overcoat?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed drily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh! Paul!&mdash;we&#8217;ll avoid delicate subjects, please. But since I
am in the confessional, I ought to add that I haven&#8217;t a coat or waistcoat.
Misfortune makes us acquainted with strange underclothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul Pangbutt smiled; but a frown followed close upon the smile,
and blackened it. He was possessed of that peculiar egoism which,
at the sight of the pitiful, is but roused to a delicious self-pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he; and a little suspicion of patronage slipped into his
manner, as it does when we are content to comfort our friends with
phrases&mdash;&#8220;I have not forgotten what makeshifts were in Paris&mdash;before
I made my mark.... I always detested frayed cuffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>A funny little smile played about the lips of the seated man; he
nodded grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, yes. Having no shirt at all has <i>that</i> advantage&mdash;the cuffs do
not fray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s scowl came flitting back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know.... You and the others always made a jest of the
disgusting pinch and meanness of it all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The weary man nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; said he, and he sighed&mdash;&#8220;the road was very
weary&mdash;very dusty&mdash;sometimes&mdash;in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other strode vigorously up and down the room, with that vigour
that had set him on the road to success: his eyes were fixed within:</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> determined at the first chance I got to shake off that dust of
the students&#8217; quarter of Paris. I detested the untidiness of them all&mdash;the
leanness and the grim jest of it&mdash;and the everlasting loans that
were never paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony&#8217;s face, as he watched the impatient striding from under his
brows, listening to the triumphant note of success, flickered with a grim
smile. Paul Pangbutt had not been exactly notorious for the lending
of loans. It came to him that his quest for help was not going to be
an easy one.</p>

<p>The other suddenly came to a halt, and looked keenly at Anthony
where he sat; remembering that this brooding man was the real subject
of talk, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;are things really as low with you as you say, Anthony?...
You always made a jest of hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony laughed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;And sometimes we got a good deal of hard work out of a jest; eh,
Paul?&#8221; The smile died out of his eyes as soon as he had spoken:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
&#8220;No,&#8221; he added, &#8220;there&#8217;s no jest in it&mdash;unless the gods laugh at misfortune....
I am about at the end of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt assumed the fatherly note:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I hope you will not mind my saying so, but
you were always most reckless in your expenditure&mdash;or rather in your
loans to all that army of hangers-on about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came to Anthony, as he stood in the withering blight of this man&#8217;s
lack of sympathy, that if he were going to ask for help he must set
aside all delicacy and put the situation before him bluntly. He made
an unwilling start:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years ago, Paul,&#8221; he said, &#8220;after you had made your mark in
Paris, and were doing the round of the foreign courts, you no doubt
heard that Caroline made rather a sensation with a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read it,&#8221; he said&mdash;but his attitude was enigma.</p>

<p>Anthony was relieved to find there was to be no oratorial protest in
honour of Style. He went on as though repeating a distasteful task he
had set himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been attacked from all sides. It is as dead&mdash;as&mdash;a railway
sandwich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is rather a misfortune,&#8221; said Pangbutt.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. He felt strangely ashamed&mdash;of himself&mdash;of his
friend. And it flashed through his thinking parts, with lightning
stroke, that this was the man whom Caroline had nursed through the
typhoid.</p>

<p>He was roused from his reflections by Pangbutt&#8217;s sharp question:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He searched about in his mind for what he had last said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Me? Oh, ah, yes; I tried to grow a garden of literature in
Fleet Street&mdash;to bring to blossom the tender buds of the new school
of thought. But my star was not in journalism. My paper was burnt
up in the fire of the young immortals who flocked to my office, whose
masterpieces few would buy&mdash;or read.&#8221; He smiled a wan smile, and
sighed: &#8220;The paper has gone into ash.... That&#8217;s why, when the
wind blows keen, there is so much dust in Fleet Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s eyes were fixed critically upon his own survey of this
man&#8217;s past, and he had but half listened to the other&#8217;s words:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole,&#8221; said he drily, &#8220;you have not been very fortunate,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony laughed sadly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>It was definitely borne in upon him that he would never be able to
ask this man for money.</p>

<p>The other was embarrassed by the silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he asked uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Anthony roused himself. He took up the thread of his appeal, but
he now went on vaguely&mdash;he felt that it was hopeless:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ah, yes.... Well, my verse is sunk to the honour of neglect&mdash;which
is not a matter wholly wanting in subtle flattery, since all the
clever young men tell me it is the reward of true poetry. But&mdash;here&#8217;s
food!&#8221; he cried, as the door opened and the butler entered, carrying a
tray, well laden: &#8220;Here&#8217;s food&mdash;so poetry go hang!&#8221; He seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
carving-knife almost before Dukes had set down the tray; and the
austere servant took up the other discarded empty tray and softly
withdrew from the room. &#8220;A most radiant fowl!&#8221; cried Anthony,
carving it with swift precision.... &#8220;I say, Paul&mdash;you won&#8217;t mind my
taking the wings in my pocket for the youngster&mdash;he&#8217;s been a little
sickly of late!&#8221;</p>

<p>He carved off the wings and breast, and his searching glance fell
on a large handsome quarto that lay upon the throne by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;a large-paper edition!&#8221; He turned it over and
saw that it was verse. &#8220;What idiot has been writing verses now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a volume of collected poems by Sir Gilders Persimmon,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indecent old thing!... May I have the fly-leaf for the
chicken?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt almost put out his hand in panic, fearing sacrilege; but
he said instead, rather stiffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an autograph copy from my friend, Sir Gilders Persimmon;
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;quite so. It&#8217;s luxury to write poetry when you&#8217;re rich,&#8221;
he said&mdash;&#8220;poetry should be handsomely treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Anthony&mdash;we scoff at riches&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who scoffs at riches?&#8221; Anthony looked up sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all sneer at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t trouble <i>my</i> sleep much&mdash;not half so much as the lack
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt smiled drily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you confess by insinuation that it&#8217;s very pleasant
to be even so discredited a thing as a millionaire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Paul. I don&#8217;t call on &#8217;em. When all&#8217;s said, they
are no worse than the folk who do call on &#8217;em. The rich man,
too, stands before his abysses&mdash;he has his blood-curdlings like the
poorest.... There are honest men and dishonest, even amongst the
rich. Look at your speculative millionaire&mdash;your mighty company-promoter!
He don&#8217;t sleep too well, thank God; but look at him....
To-day, society is licking his boots&mdash;licking them, Paul&mdash;for who so
sublime a boot-licker as your hereditary flunkey of the Court? To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;
Hang it, I&#8217;m talking like a curate.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;I
always gabble of millionaires in my sleep when the landlady is pressing
for the rent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s something rather wonderful
about a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very proper and right sentiment, Paul! Of course, a millionaire
is a colossal article of commerce. Bigness appeals to the imagination.
So a school-boy looks at a bishop and thinks the works of God
are very wonderful.... But riches are comparative&mdash;there&#8217;s a
millionaire who cannot buy a digestion. Give me a competency&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s lip curled:</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is a competency?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;H&#8217;m&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up suddenly, listening.</p>

<p>There was a distant ring of a bell.</p>

<p>Anthony hurriedly folded his handkerchief over the scraps of
food, and thrust them into his pocket.</p>

<p>He strode towards Pangbutt as though to say something&mdash;hesitated&mdash;he
could not bring himself to ask for money. There was a second
peal at the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be off,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I hear visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>And waving his hand to Pangbutt he stepped quickly to the
doorway.</p>

<p>When he reached the door he again hesitated&mdash;shook his head&mdash;and
letting himself quietly out, closed the door gently after him.</p>

<p>Paul Pangbutt was alone.</p>

<p>He stood brooding.</p>

<p>His lips moved into a complacent smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe my success awed him,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Ambition shrinks from looking down the Ladder</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> brooding man was still standing in the middle of the great
studio when the butler entered, with catlike tread, and handed him a
card on a silver salver.</p>

<p>Pangbutt took the card without looking at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take away the tray, Dukes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He pointed with a trace of disgust to the broken meats, and, as he
watched the silent servant gathering up the relics of the hurried feast,
all that shabby Bohemian life, the very thought of which he had
banished for years, came flooding back with disgust across the threshold
of his splendid home.... How he loathed it!... But&mdash;the
strange irony of it all! That the brilliant ones of the time of his
pupillage should have gone under!... He himself had been the
commonplace one, the near to dullard&mdash;he smiled&mdash;but here was he,
and there were they!... Strange how the promise of youth is unfulfilled!...
The Baddlesmeres gone under! God! they of all
people!... Whilst for him? Fame, stretching out a vast glittering
prospect as he topped the hill of endeavour.... He had left no
smallest effort unmade to advance his own interests&mdash;and he stood at
last in view of the promised land where hang the glittering prizes.
By heavens! they were within hand&#8217;s reach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was roused by the butler&#8217;s voice, as the old servant opened the
door to depart:</p>

<p>&#8220;And this gentleman downstairs, sir?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; Pangbutt glanced at the card in his fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eustace Lovegood!&#8221; he murmured in surprise. &#8220;H&#8217;m&mdash;he sends
up his card&mdash;evidently all goes well with Eustace Lovegood!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Dukes:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;show him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old servant vanished, the door stealthily closing after him.</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s face was scarred with a self-satisfied smirk: &#8220;They find
me in rather altered circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the comfort of the reflection.</p>

<p>He was about to stride towards the fireplace and take up a baronial
attitude, but put his hands behind his back instead, and stared at the
floor, pondering. He tried to rouse his memory:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;But&mdash;let me see&mdash;Lovegood made rather a mark? What
was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The door opened, and Eustace Lovegood strode tragically into the
room, the old black cloak swinging at his back.</p>

<p>Pangbutt turned: &#8220;O lord!&#8221; he growled into his beard, &#8220;another
of the failures!&#8221;</p>

<p>He eyed Lovegood cynically until he halted; and, seeing that he
would have to speak, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked to see me, Mr. Lovegood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood put his heels together and bowed.</p>

<p>Pangbutt had to speak again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Eustace Lovegood strode up to him, put his strong hand on his
shoulder, and looked him in the face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said in his deep bass&mdash;&#8220;nothing ... except to
remember that we were once friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt, in spite of a biting desire to play the swaggering lord, at
once took the defensive. This man made him feel diffident even on
his own elaborate carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you choose to remind me of that to-night?&#8221; he asked
sullenly, trying to assert himself.</p>

<p>Eustace took his hand from his shoulder, and fixed his gloomy eyes
upon him:</p>

<p>&#8220;As I stood in the shadows of your hall just now,&#8221; said he slowly,
&#8220;Anthony Baddlesmere passed out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt uttered a light cynical laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;without nodding to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood&#8217;s great brows met in a black frown:</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyes were on a broken career.... But I saw that he had
not yet become a good beggar.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sneer curled the bearded lips of the other:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; he asked flippantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am better practised.... I have come to beg for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s lips curled into a deeper contempt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you were always a good borrower, Eustace Lovegood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not grown rich upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I owe you anything?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Pangbutt hesitated:</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am bound to confess&mdash;not for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your confession involves by implication that there may be
virtue even in borrowing&mdash;for those in need!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I have grown virtuous&mdash;I have come to borrow.... Nay,
man&mdash;to ask you to pay back.... Anthony Baddlesmere&mdash;did he
want help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not ask for help,&#8221; said the painter lamely.</p>

<p>The eyes of the great tragic man before him saw into the nakedness
of his very conceit; and Paul Pangbutt realized that his chief weapon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his cold pride of egoism, was useless against the truth-seeking eyes of
Eustace Lovegood&mdash;was without awe to him. He recoiled under the
calm eyes of this big gentle fellow as he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul&mdash;you never could see the soul in a man.... You could only
value what part of him could be bought in shops, or whittled into
shapes in the academies. The man who was here to-night is almost
destitute. Anthony and Caroline Baddlesmere&mdash;who were the
Bountifuls to all of us in Paris&mdash;destitute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the cause of it,&#8221; Pangbutt answered sullenly.</p>

<p>An ugly frown came over the big man&#8217;s eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he helped you to this.&#8221; He swept his hand round the
room slowly. &#8220;He gave you a footing at the Embassy in Paris....
I need not go into details.... The rest is here. And you could let
him leave your house ashamed to ask for help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt made an effort to take the domineering careless attitude;
but he realized that his play-acting was worse than lost on this man&#8217;s
grim regard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not grasp that it was so serious, Lovegood.... I will&mdash;drop
in one day&mdash;and&mdash;see if something cannot be done&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the smile of contempt move the pale heavy features of
Eustace Lovegood as he shrugged his huge shoulders, and, with an
exhaustive snort of disgust, strode slowly out of the room.</p>

<p>The door closed after him with a loud resounding slam, rattled on
its hinges, and was still.</p>

<p>Pangbutt stood brooding with frowning eyes fixed upon it:</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovegood never loses the grand manner,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;even when
he has no necktie. Damnation! the Past seems never to be buried....
We think the day is dead because we blowout the candle and lie down
at night. We forget the world&#8217;s the same&mdash;&#8217;tis we that sleep. Tush!
the Past is never dead&mdash;until it&#8217;s our winding-sheet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw himself reflected in a large mirror. He gazed at the well-groomed
man of the world that stood there in the mirrored make-believe
room, solid as he; and he laughed bitterly as it came to him
that this dandified spruce shadow that mimicked his magnificence had
thought to shake off at a wish the years of sordid striving together with
the Things that had been Done and Rejected and&mdash;Forsaken!...
Tshah; he had been congratulating this spruce fellow upon it only a
few minutes gone by&mdash;thanking his most gentlemanly star that he had
done with the whole gang. And to-day&mdash;they were pushing stealthily
at his doors, creeping into his magnificent home, nay, bursting into his
life again&mdash;thrusting jeering faces into his, whether he would or not.
Indeed, his smug shadow sneered at him&mdash;for behind the well-bred
silence of his old comrades was the knowledge of his low origin&mdash;and
he had no pride in aught but hiding what had been to a bigger man
his source of pride.</p>

<p>Perhaps he ought to help&mdash;for decency&#8217;s sake; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Strange&mdash;these were the very people who had given him his
chance in life. But for them, he had still been a mediocrity in
Paris.</p>

<p>But why should he have the whole crew &#8220;hail-fellow&#8221;?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>If a man is to rise above the crowd he must stand alone&mdash;be rid of
encumbrances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He started:</p>

<p>A door slammed below.</p>

<p>There was the loud noise of a gathering tumult without. It was
coming up the stairs&mdash;his stairs!</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse it! is all Bedlam abroad to-night?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>He strode angrily towards the uproar beyond the great folding
doors; but they were flung open, and there entered a gust of loud
laughter and the shuffle of many feet upon the stairs.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is discovered that the Strength of Genius
may lie in the Hair</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a loud shout of laughter there burst riotously into the room
several young fellows, pushing before them the indignant and expostulating
Lovegood.</p>

<p>A shock-headed fellow, Rippley the sculptor, dressed with the picturesque
carelessness of an art student, left the others, advanced to
their scowling host, and said breezily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;ere, Paul Pangbutt&mdash;the boys have come to give old Jack
Lawrence a house-warming&mdash;down the street, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Pangbutt icily; and with cutting coldness he added:
&#8220;I presume that this news should interest me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley was hugely pleased:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, rather! He&#8217;s setting up a studio almost next door to you&mdash;but
the old rip isn&#8217;t in this evening; so, as we have the beer and
stuff in a dray outside, we&#8217;ve converted it into a surprise party for you
instead, d&#8217;you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s blanched face was moved to a sneer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, so spontaneous an honour cannot but flatter,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; roared Rippley jovially. He went up to his sulky host
and slapped him on the shoulder. It floated through Pangbutt&#8217;s
mind with something like a twinge of jealousy that they had never
given <i>him</i> a house-warming when he took his studio, months ago
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said bitterly&mdash;&#8220;make yourselves at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sculptor gave him a sounding thump on the shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good generous fellow!&#8221; cried he, and winked at the
others. &#8220;All the scum of Bohemia is coming here to-night. We have
invited &#8217;em&mdash;in your name.... <i>Of course</i> you don&#8217;t mind. I <i>said</i>
you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the open door there came gusts of hilarity from below, and
the sound of horseplay.</p>

<p>The sculptor chuckled.</p>

<p>Pangbutt scowled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;treat the place like a pot-house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course I
am delighted,&#8221; he added ironically.</p>

<p>Rippley turned and winked an eye solemnly at the others; he burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into a jovial laugh, and gripping Pangbutt&#8217;s shoulder with his great
hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Paul,&#8221; cried he&mdash;&#8220;of course you are!... But we
found old Lovegood before us&mdash;the sly old dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left his sulky host, and, walking up to Lovegood, punched his
embarrassed bulk in the ribs.</p>

<p>Lovegood strode over to the brooding man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pangbutt,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;you would rather have them go. Why don&#8217;t
you say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;let them alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved the subject aside irritably with his hand, and walked
impatiently to the fireplace, where he turned and, leaning his shoulders
against the mantel, scowled at the riot.</p>

<p>There was a shuffle of feet, as of men carrying a heavy burden, and,
with a roar, the noisy crew swung through the great doorway and
came swarming into the room, headed by half a dozen that carried a
full beer-barrel on slings, followed by a red-headed fellow frantically
blaring a trombone before another who carried Andrew Blotte upon
his shoulders, crowned with a wreath of roses and considerably the
worse for strong liquors.</p>

<p>They gave their sulking host a shout as they streamed in. The rest
of the noisy crew, talking and laughing, escorted a couple of pretty
but gauche girl-models, who were awkwardly carrying bouquets as
they might have carried cabbages; long streamers of coloured ribbon
hung from their nosegays.</p>

<p>The barrel was carried at the run to the most handy armchair, and
plumped into the seat. The handicraftsmen of Louis Quinze must
have turned in their graves&mdash;it was a fine specimen of the period.
With a whoop they set hiccuping Andrew Blotte astride of the barrel&mdash;one
of the girls, picking up his wreath of roses, which had fallen to
the floor, set it awry on his head. From under its shadow his eyes
blinked drunkenly at the room.</p>

<p>The men were all smoking.</p>

<p>Rippley came forward and, addressing Pangbutt, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind our smoking, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not aware my permission was necessary&mdash;but of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Of course</i> you don&#8217;t,&#8221; roared Rippley; and turning to the others
he put his tongue in his cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, you may smoke,&#8221; said he; &#8220;nor, indeed, has friend
Paul any conscientious objections to the ladies smokin&#8217;.&#8221; He turned
to the red-haired man with the trombone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Milk the bell,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my fluffsome Reubens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The red-haired fellow with the incipient beard, whom they called
Fluffy Reubens, uttered a startled wail on the trombone, and walking
over to the bell-pull, tolled the bell solemnly as he might have milked
a cow.</p>

<p>He smiled at the peal that rang and rang through the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a good bell,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Nothing throaty about its
top notes.&#8221; He turned to his scowling host: &#8220;We will put you to as
little trouble as possible, Paul,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;so I ring the bell. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you would not mind asking your swoggle-eyed bottle-washer for the
glasses it wouldn&#8217;t strain the etiquette&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley burst out laughing:</p>

<p>&#8220;That idiotic hireling man of yours thought we were bailiffs&mdash;his
language was really quite naughty&mdash;for a butler. So Fluffy flung
himself at his old legs and I clapped a hand over his fowling-piece&mdash;the
language was within an ace of being obscene. We whipped him
off his legs and sat on his chest and head, or he would have bawled
murder. Of course we <i>quite</i> understand, indeed sympathize with, his
haughty attitude towards tax-gatherers; but we cannot lightly put
aside his stone-blindness to genius when he sees it in full flare of the
electric light&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The old butler, sulky as his master, appeared at
the door and stood there with stiff dignity. Rippley turned to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Glasses, mister!&#8221; cried he.</p>

<p>The old servant took not the slightest notice&mdash;he was deaf to all
vulgar appeal.</p>

<p>Pangbutt nodded to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Glasses, Dukes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man solemnly turned and left the room.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens, who had been gazing sentimentally at the portrait
upon the easel, turned to the gilt chair that yawned empty amidst its
picturesque setting on the painter&#8217;s throne:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! the society beauty has flown!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley kissed his hand to the portrait:</p>

<p>&#8220;I put it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that Eustace Lovegood take the beauty&#8217;s
chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a din of acclamation; and the big man stepped tragically
on to the throne and took the seat. His pale face smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no longer a vulgar brawl,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;but an ordered
debauch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley turned and, staring at Blotte where he sat solemnly astride
of the cask, blinking drunkenly from under his wreath, gave him a
hail:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, my bilious Bacchus!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;A smile to greet this
picnic!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is Bacchus without the cup?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte, astride the cask, raised his hand as for oration, but
overbalanced and tumbled from the barrel to the carpet. Several
sprang to help him to his feet; and as he stood with difficulty they
restored his fallen wreath. He strode with drunken solemnity into the
middle of the room, towards his host, where he stood brooding before
the fireplace; and as Blotte came the scowl left the hard pale face of
the other, and his mouth fell open a little way&mdash;but he took command
of himself in the winking of an eyelid, and the blood poured back
into his heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; slipped from him in a hoarse whisper; &#8220;Andrew
Blotte!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte pulled himself up to a halt, and blinking at his
memory, shuffling amongst the faces that were ghosts of the past, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tried to gather his rambling thoughts together, and said with slow
precision and friendly confidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I once knew a&mdash;fellow (hic)&mdash;rather like you.... Clean-shaven
poetic-looking fellow, rather good-looking&mdash;nevertheless&mdash;rather like
you.&#8221; He giggled drunkenly. &#8220;He&mdash;<i>he</i> thought he could paint, too.&#8221;
He blew through his lips. &#8220;We all thought we could do things&mdash;in
Paris.... Youth lives on illusions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It struck Paul Pangbutt as he stood there, his arms folded before
him, and his eyes set on the poor drunken wreck of a once brilliant
youth, that it was nothing less than devil&#8217;s irony that had sent <i>this</i>
broken man into his life <i>this</i> night&mdash;the night which his profession
might, as likely as not, have chosen to do him honour&mdash;it was the
evening of the elections at the Academy.</p>

<p>Blotte roused; and added solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was one of your good fellows&mdash;always the fine gentleman&mdash;with
as keen an eye on his dignity as&mdash;a&mdash;colonial bishop. Nevertheless,
he was rather like you.&#8221; He sniggered, and came closer to
Pangbutt; gazing at him hazily he added: &#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me, but I&#8217;ve
quite forgotten the point&mdash;and I can&#8217;t remember your name.... We
have not been formally introduced&mdash;there is that excuse for us....
Oh, ah, yes, though&mdash;I remember&mdash;to be sure&mdash;(hic)&mdash;yes. He stood
just about your height&mdash;he was a good-looking fellow&mdash;whee-hew&mdash;better-looking
fellow than you.... Of course&mdash;that&#8217;s strictly between
you and me and&#8221;&mdash;he swept his hand towards the silent others&mdash;&#8220;and
pandlemonium!... Looked like a poet&mdash;but his brain was&mdash;mostly&mdash;self-respect....
That was <i>it</i>&mdash;<i>he</i> looked a man&mdash;<i>I</i> was
wholly insignificant.... <i>He</i> had the grand manner&mdash;<i>I</i> didn&#8217;t give a
slop-can for manners. Never did. Always had a positive idioshincrasy
against dancing-masters&mdash;except for dancing.... Of course,&#8221; he
added slowly, gazing with heavy eyes into the past&mdash;&#8220;of course when
a woman appeared on the scene, he&mdash;cut me out&mdash;hiccup&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A sneer came to Pangbutt&#8217;s pale lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Such modesty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Blotte,&#8221; roared the sculptor, Rippley.</p>

<p>The poor drunken fellow took no slightest notice of the interruption,
but continued his tale:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;it was easy enough. It wasn&#8217;t worth scoring the
trick. But&mdash;he was a shabby devil&mdash;though he stood just about your
height....&#8221; He whistled aimlessly.... &#8220;About this time, what
d&#8217;you think? the fellow got into the Embassy set&mdash;hiccup&mdash;God knows
how!... Don&#8217;t ask me.... The Baddlesmeres were connected
with Embassy people&mdash;and the fellow got a footing.... C√¶sar was
always ambitious.... So he dropped Kate Ormsby&mdash;poor little
devil!... She was such a pretty creature&mdash;and I spent the rest of
my youth in telling her that the fellow would come back to her&mdash;God
forgive me!...&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt shifted uneasily; but his cynical voice showed no uneasiness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said he coldly&mdash;&#8220;your biography is not without romance,
Mr. Blotte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Blotte. &#8220;She sings outside taverns now....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I consider it a most damned unladylike thing to do.... Saw her&mdash;last
winter&mdash;snow on ground&mdash;and formally asked her hand in
marriage&mdash;hiccup. But,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;she&mdash;hiccup&mdash;she said I wasn&#8217;t
sober.... Rather bad taste of her, I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The man-servant entered the room with the glasses on a tray;
Fluffy Reubens nudged Rippley, and jerked his thumb towards
Blotte.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Blotte,&#8221; cried Fluffy Reubens&mdash;&#8220;and dry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; cried Rippley&mdash;&#8220;the glasses, gentlemen! Blotte, I give
you better advice&mdash;come and be moistened.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drunken man nodded to his host:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me,&#8221; he said; and he strolled off unsteadily towards
the glasses.</p>

<p>There was a loud shout of laughter, as Rippley, to cause a diversion,
poured a libation of beer on the old butler&#8217;s bald head, dedicating him
to Venus: the old man, with the beer trickling down his nose, and
scorn upon his lip, solemnly withdrew.</p>

<p>Rippley started the cask of beer, the girls handing the glasses about
as they were filled.</p>

<p>Lovegood, master of the revels, coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;How naturally Rippley presides at the cask!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Heaven
meant him for an honest publican; but native conceit, or some other
maggot in the brain, turned his hands to sculpture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt fretted in sullen silence, wondering when the crew would
be done and gone. He even told himself that it would have been less
embarrassing if he had gone to see the Baddlesmeres&mdash;and for the rest
of the evening he brooded upon it.</p>

<p>Lovegood sat back in his chair, glad to get all eyes away from the
host:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, English-brewed ale to-night!&#8221; said he tragically. &#8220;None of
your sour wines of France.&#8221; He turned to one of the girl-models&mdash;&#8220;Sweet
Andromache, a tankard for the chair!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The girl carried beer to him in a tumbler, giggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;give me the juice of the pagan grape&mdash;of such alone is
brewed the nectar of the gods!&#8221; said a slim man who lounged on a
sofa, glass in hand. He was Aubrey, the poet, and he was as beautiful
as a woman, and with his mass of dark hair drawn from his brows and
hiding his ears he looked like one: &#8220;Ah, that dissipation should destroy
the complexion, and to be intoxicated should have grown unpoetic&mdash;to
be drunk and disorderly simply to be sordid! The exquisite
orgies of the deliciously wicked Greeks are done. The Bacchic frenzy
is dead. Nay, Pan&mdash;even Pan&mdash;Pan is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears came to the eyes of Andrew Blotte, and he shook his head
sadly. The wreath came over one eye.</p>

<p>Lovegood blew his nose dramatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, poor Pan!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Really it is quite a tearful statement.
It had escaped me that it was the anniversary of Pan.&#8221; He
turned to the girl-model they called Andromache and held out his
empty tumbler: &#8220;Repeat the dose, therefore, Andromache,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;we must drink to the translation of Pan&mdash;since we cannot go to his
funeral. Though I don&#8217;t wholly give up Pan on Aubrey&#8217;s mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
report. Poets are so scandalous; they will make any misstatement
to fit a rhyme&mdash;or blast careers to assist a dramatic situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley withdrew his nose from a foaming glass of beer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you poet johnnies would bury Pan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
always diggin&#8217; &#8217;im up&mdash;or the other dead Greeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey yawned wearily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t jabber art, Rippley. You make my head ache....&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt roused, and, walking over to Lovegood, asked him in a
whisper for the Baddlesmeres&#8217; address. The big man fumbled in the
breast-pocket of his shiny black coat.</p>

<p>A shout of protest caught his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Aubrey,&#8221; cried Rippley&mdash;&#8220;sheer nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood looked up, and put out his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order, gentlemen!&#8221; said he in thundering bass. &#8220;It is most unseemly
to insinuate that poets talk nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>He searched again for the pencil, and wrote the address on the
other&#8217;s cuff. They were roused from their colloquy by a quarrel. Pangbutt
returned to the fireplace, his brows set.</p>

<p>Lovegood stood up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order, gentlemen, order!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>Aubrey languidly appealed to him from the sofa:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rippley says he has an idea,&#8221; he complained pathetically.</p>

<p>Lovegood motioned for silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Aubrey! you should never repeat a scandal,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Rippley laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, though&mdash;a rippin&#8217; idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said Lovegood, and he coughed. &#8220;Attention, gentlemen&mdash;whilst
Mr. Rippley yields up an entirely original and rippin&#8217;
idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley sniggered:</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me feel quite nervous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But&mdash;<i>you</i> know, I&#8217;ve
got a rippin&#8217; idea for a statoo: A fellow struggling alone against the
weight of his pre-ordained destiny, which keeps coming back on &#8217;im,
don&#8217;t you know! He works for Fame, but finds his load getting
heavier and heavier to his hand. Ambition, Pluck, Endurance&mdash;all
are no good. Doom broods over all&mdash;Span of Life don&#8217;t give enough
time&mdash;Age creeps on and numbs his Strength. And when the poor
devil gets near the top of the hill, there stands Death at the summit to
cut him down at the end of his labours&mdash;and he sees the night-mist of
Oblivion stretching beyond&mdash;a mist in which the greatest names are
faintly dying away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear plasterer,&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens, &#8220;how are you
going to express this in stone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; said the tousle-headed sculptor, warm to his idea.
&#8220;That Greek Johnny that pushed a great hanking stone up a hill, and
kept letting it go again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He made an effort to recall the name
and shook his head: &#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t &#8217;Erkyools&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey tittered, and languidly corrected him with cutting precision:</p>

<p>&#8220;Her&mdash;cu&mdash;les, Rippley&mdash;Hercules!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t &#8217;im,&#8221; said Rippley impatiently. &#8220;T&#8217;other
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;Rippley,&#8221; said the languid poet, turning half-shut eyes of contempt
upon him, &#8220;your originality staggers me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ra-ther!&#8221; said Rippley. &#8220;When I got that idea you could have
knocked me down with the brains of a minor poet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Grecian gentleman who pushed the&mdash;er&mdash;hanking great stone
up the hill,&#8221; said he with measured accent, &#8220;I have read somewhere,
was called Sisyphus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley bounced and clutched at the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sisyphus&mdash;that&#8217;s the chap!... Knew Aubrey was wrong about
its being &#8217;Erkyools.... Rummy things the old Greeks used to do!
luckily for sculpture and the schoolmasters.&#8221; He bent his eyes on his
idea again: &#8220;But what licks me is Fame!... Such a comical thing
is Fame!... Now, look at this fellow Sisyphus: A great muscular
chap pushes the dickens of a big stone up a hill, and keeps having to
let it go again before he reaches the top. It ain&#8217;t much to build
a reputation on. But Plato or some blanky poet comes along and
writes it down&mdash;and that fellow goes pushing and heaving that stone
up a hill through the ages. Then look at Aubrey&mdash;<i>he</i> works just as
hard at his confounded rhymes; yet no one reads <i>him</i>, but everyone
goes on talking about &#8217;Omer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Omar Khayyam?&#8221; asked Aubrey flippantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Khayyam be damned!&#8221; said the shock-headed sculptor. &#8220;No&mdash;old
&#8217;Omer &#8217;imself. A fine, hairy old fellow, with big workmanlike
head! Good solid old poetry! None of your rhymes and jingles
and frills and coloured neckties and long nails and modern&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood tapped his glass on the arm of the judgment-seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the painful duty of the chair,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to remind our
sculptor that he claims to have been infected with an <i>original</i> and
rippin&#8217; idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley shook himself peevishly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This bleating minor poet keeps diggin&#8217; his dandified elbow into
my ideas until he makes &#8217;em sulk in their tents like&mdash;like Ash-heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Achilles, Rippley&mdash;Achilles!&#8221; cooed the poet gently.</p>

<p>Rippley turned upon him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, poet,&#8221; said he, walking up to the languid Aubrey, &#8220;you&#8217;re
looking sallow; you poets don&#8217;t take enough exercise. I bet I put you
under that sofa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey rose to his feet in alarm, and took up a mild attitude of
protest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be vulgar, Rippley!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>But the thick-set little sculptor jumped at him and bore him to the
ground. The two rolled on the carpet until Rippley, getting the grip
of the plaintive poet, pushed his slim figure, expostulating, beneath the
sofa, where he disappeared from view under its hangings, amidst a roar
of applause.</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poetry is fallen on rough times indeed,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Pangbutt stood frowning at the riot. How these tomfools took him
back to the years of his insignificance and Paris!</p>

<p>The door was flung open and a stoutish woman, her hands thrust in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the side-pockets of her jacket, stepped into the doorway with
swaggering stride. Glancing calmly round the room, she called airily,
in a strident, jolly voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Pangbutt?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me this rotten party was to be at Jack Lawrence&#8217;s. But
his place is as black as your blooming frontispiece. I&#8217;ve been huntin&#8217;
for this scum all over the shop, until a policeman sniggered and told
me there was a deal of cock-crowin&#8217; goin&#8217; on here.&#8221; She turned to the
roomful of them: &#8220;Hullo, boys! and what are you all up to?...
Nothing unladylike, I hope, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed the question jovially.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; they all cried.</p>

<p>Blotte waved his arm, standing by the barrel:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, jovial Emma,&#8221; said he, and hiccuped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; she queried; &#8220;quite sure I&#8217;m not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; they chorused. &#8220;Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte took up an oratorical attitude by the beer-cask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in&mdash;rollicking Emma&mdash;you&#8217;re making quite a draught&mdash;gives
me&mdash;hic&mdash;quite a chill. I must have something to warm me&mdash;from
within outwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew his empty tumbler out of his pocket.</p>

<p>Emma laughed shrilly, and flung the door to:</p>

<p>&#8220;My word,&#8221; cried she, &#8220;you <i>are</i> going it!... Heigho! I say,
boys, I have only a paragraph or two to send in to the papers and I&#8217;m
finished; so let me rest.... Which is the largest and most comfortable
seat?&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved towards the empty sofa.</p>

<p>As she swung herself round to sit down, she said shrilly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see that poetic idiot Aubrey here. Where&#8217;s he braying
to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t braying, robustious Emma,&#8221; said Lovegood from the
chair. &#8220;He&#8217;s on all fours, eating the thistles of humiliation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff plumped her weight on to the sofa, and a wail arose
from under her.</p>

<p>She started&mdash;then laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul! I have known a sofa to groan before&mdash;but this
one cries out!&#8221; she rattled; and added indignantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;As if I didn&#8217;t know my figure was gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey&#8217;s voice came plaintively from under her foundations:</p>

<p>&#8220;Most adorable Emma,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You press heavily upon a poet&#8217;s husk,&#8221; he said solemnly. &#8220;Arise,
madam, as you love poetry, and free him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma arose.</p>

<p>As Aubrey crawled out, all tousled and tossed, from under the
sofa, a shout went up. He gathered himself on to his feet and brushed
his knees.</p>

<p>She sat down:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ecstatic ass is not dead, after all,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Aubrey bowed, polite and affected as always:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, madam,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;the weight of your opposition crushes me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood chuckled:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have not his death upon your conscience, glorious Emma.
The recorded word remains unbroken&mdash;no one has yet seen a dead
donkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is of no consequence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But there are other&mdash;serious
things. There&#8217;s no doubt about it&mdash;I&#8217;ve begun to apologize for
my figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Emma!&#8221; Lovegood&#8217;s pale face became serious &#8220;You
should never apologize for the acts of Providence. It is most
irreligious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey, who had taken his stand against the end of the sofa, folded
his arms, and said absently:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;The wit that rouses rippling laughter now,</div>
<div class="verse">May be but winnow&#8217;d chaff at fifty&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Raise but a cackling laugh at fourscore years.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>They all thumped on the tables and tapped heels upon the floor:</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; cried the chorus.</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff stood up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh!&#8221; she hushed; &#8220;let the inspired idiot speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down in a hush of silence.</p>

<p>Aubrey ran his hands through his hair:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;The eyes that catch our eyes, and check our breath with sweet, delicious ecstasies</div>
<div class="verse">May be but line-marked eyes, with disillusion&#8217;d sight at fifty&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Tear-fill&#8217;d, and inward cast in age&#8217;s loneliness at fourscore years.</div>
<div class="verse">But shall we therefore fear to laugh&mdash;since jests grow old?</div>
<div class="verse">Or cease to garner for old age&#8217;s ease&mdash;since graveyards yawn alike for spendthrift and for thrifty?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall we fulfil, with homage of a loveless life, black Pessimism&#8217;s scold</div>
<div class="verse">That that we do matters as little, after the years we lease, as the worn idols to whom none now bow?&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Emma Hartroff, pointing to the vacant place beside her, waved him
to it:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!... Sit down, Aubrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey sat down, and, lolling back comfortably in the corner of it,
he spread himself out luxuriously.</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte cheered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent! Ex&#8217;lent!&#8221; he said solemnly. &#8220;That ain&#8217;t&mdash;hiccup&mdash;altogether
bad.... Wonderful thing, genius!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood tapped on his chair-arm, and there was silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my painful duty,&#8221; said he, rising to his feet, &#8220;to put it to
the republic of letters that our poet be not again heard this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all held out their hands, and solemnly turned their thumbs
down.</p>

<p>Lovegood nodded gloomily:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ayes have it,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;Citizens, I thank you for
recording in dignified silence the contempt which you felt compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to express for so pathetic an exhibition of mediocrity.&#8221; He sighed
sadly. &#8220;Beer, please, coy Andromache!...&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte strolled unsteadily over to where Emma Hartroff sat on the
sofa; and straddling out his legs he gazed at her pensively&mdash;the wreath
of roses awry over his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my merry Andrew,&#8221; said she, &#8220;get it off your chest. What&#8217;s
worrying you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Emma,&#8221; said he slowly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t do yourself justice.&#8221; He put
his head on one side critically, and uttered a rending hiccup: &#8220;you
ought to (hiccup) put plum-juice on the&mdash;lobes&mdash;of your ears. It
would make you look so voluptuous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But look here, Master Andrew, what have
<i>you</i> been doing of late?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood swaying and balancing himself, the wreath awry on his
head, and hiccuped:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to discover the source of heartburn in a radish,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t stay any longer, adorable Emma,&#8221; he added
flirtily, &#8220;but will you come with me to the sunny south to see the
almonds bloom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I must go alone.&#8221; And he added dramatically, spilling
much beer in Emma&#8217;s lap: &#8220;Away from this black cauldron of the
city, to meet the pageant of the Spring!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and shuffled over slowly to Paul Pangbutt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, old&mdash;Polyglot!...&#8221; He crooned. &#8220;I forget your name&mdash;but
I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t stay.... This palace of varieties&#8221; (he waved
his arm round the room) is most alluring&mdash;but I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;I can&#8217;t stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt nodded, humouring him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you do.&#8221; Blotte burst out into a great laugh. He
suddenly button-holed him again: &#8220;I say, I suppose <i>you</i> wouldn&#8217;t care
to&mdash;come&mdash;and see the almonds bloom?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed at his dandified host, and slowly shook his head. The
wreath came down over one eye:</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t come to meet the pageant of the Spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head in answer to the other&#8217;s shake; and, turning
clumsily, lurched towards the door.</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff called to him from her sofa:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Blotte?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the door Blotte halted and faced the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Goo&#8217;-night!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would embrace you, Emma, but there
are so many of you it would seem polygamous.&#8221;</p>

<p>He squealed gaily, and kicked out a leg&mdash;it nearly flung him off
his feet.</p>

<p>As he fumbled at the handle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; said he, hanging to the door, &#8220;quite sure you won&#8217;t
all come&mdash;and walk on air&mdash;and&mdash;sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will no one come with me to see the almonds bloom?&#8221; said he;
and fell through the doorway with a clatter, his feet inside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Pangbutt hurried after him:</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment,&#8221; said he, as he passed Lovegood. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see him out.
My guests do not require a host.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;they are a host in themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed on Pangbutt.</p>

<p>A titter went round the room.</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff sat up suddenly on the sofa:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, boys,&#8221; said she, &#8220;Anthony Baddlesmere&#8217;s a bit down at
heels, ain&#8217;t he? Eh?... Met him an hour ago&mdash;looked as if he&#8217;d
pawned his shirt. I should have thought Caroline Baddlesmere&#8217;s
book&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey opened a sleepy eye where he lay on the sofa:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says Caroline Baddlesmere?&#8221; he asked drowsily.</p>

<p>Emma turned on him:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> say Caroline Baddlesmere,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I say she has written
a book&mdash;which is more than your worst enemy could say of you,
Aubrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey yawned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Book is rather a large word, most blunt Emma. Every
school-girl prints her literary effusions nowadays. But print and
binding do not make a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>He yawned again.</p>

<p>Rippley raised his eyebrows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubrey&#8217;s quite inspired to-night,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The fussy little minor critic, Fosse, jumped into the opportunity for
an opinion:</p>

<p>&#8220;One cannot but admire the personality of Caroline Baddlesmere,&#8221;
he began.</p>

<p>Rippley winked to the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shorthand writer, please,&#8221; he called. &#8220;The lips of James Fosse
are about to drop pearls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse flushed impatiently, but held doggedly to his opportunity:</p>

<p>&#8220;But her work was bound to die. It lacked the dainty quality of
style&#8221;&mdash;he twiddled fingers in the air, seeking the expression of
subtleties too exquisite for translation by the tongue&mdash;&#8220;that illuminating
light that only comes to the virile-minded; the epigram&mdash;finesse&mdash;the
er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; growled Lovegood gloomily&mdash;&#8220;quite so, Mr. Fosse.
Unlike your genius, the thrills of cachinnation never followed at her
heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse&#8217;s fussy eyes looked perplexed:</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no, no. Perhaps not. Still&mdash;that was not exactly what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Fosse!&#8221; cried Rippley impatiently. &#8220;Let the other ass
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse sat down.</p>

<p>Aubrey drowsily took up the cue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman,&#8221; said he languidly&mdash;&#8220;woman is adorably illogical&mdash;deliciously
ridiculous&mdash;exquisitely attractive; but woman has no sense
of humour&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff laughed shrilly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;Good old Aubrey!&#8221; cried she. &#8220;I always said that our minor poet
was lineally descended from his mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; Lovegood&#8217;s bass boomed through the room. &#8220;Silence!
I will have no one insinuate that our poet&#8217;s mother was an ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tumblers on tables, and feet on floor, thundered applause.</p>

<p>Aubrey, lying back on the sofa, his arms folded, and his head
drooped forward, drowsily opened his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Caroline Baddlesmere was simply popular.
Popularity is merely a vulgar mood&mdash;signifying the commonplace&mdash;signifying
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are not above trying for it, old man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s a mighty sight easier to be unknown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey yawned:</p>

<p>&#8220;I seek nothing from popularity,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you print yourself?&#8221; asked Rippley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in love with art.... I have the perplexing preference
for the elements of inspiration rather than for the elements of
popularity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley snorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;go to sleep!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Aubrey turned to Emma Hartroff apologetically:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he murmured drowsily, &#8220;but I have been wandering
in the meads by running streams all day, and it has only made me
sleepy. I had done better to have invented my own facts in Nature&mdash;Nature
does not select&mdash;like the good God, she is most wasteful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff jumped to her feet, and strode up and down a turn
or so, her hands in her pockets. She came to a halt, and straddling
in the middle of the room, she said suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, boys&mdash;I <i>like</i> Caroline Baddlesmere!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fame, indeed, for Caroline Baddlesmere,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She nodded her head decidedly. &#8220;Caroline Baddlesmere&#8217;s
a rippin&#8217; good sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood, sitting back in his chair, eyed the straddling figure
gloomily from under his dark brows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Certificate of character for Caroline Baddlesmere!&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She nodded again. &#8220;I&#8217;m ding-dong sorry she&#8217;s struck bad
luck; but&mdash;y&#8217;know&mdash;Caroline is a bit of a new woman.... Now, <i>I</i>
like a woman to <i>be</i> a woman&mdash;and <i>act</i> like a woman&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>dress</i>
like a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was loud and prolonged laughter, and shouts of satiric
applause, and cat-calls.</p>

<p>She herself dressed like a policeman.</p>

<p>Tumblers were banged on the tables.</p>

<p>There were loud cries:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Emma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sublime Emma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gorgeous Emma!&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent her brows on her mood, and set her feet more firmly
apart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;I like a gentle voice in a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laughter became hysteric.</p>

<p>Lovegood raised a gloomy eyebrow:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Caroline Baddlesmere&#8217;s voice?&#8221; he
growled.</p>

<p>She turned on him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Eustace; can Caroline Baddlesmere cook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why should she? The Creator did not
make woman in the image of a Dutch oven!&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff sat down, and uttered a sigh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re beyond me, Eustace. I don&#8217;t like you when you&#8217;re
serious.&#8221; She turned to the others: &#8220;Our humorist is as solemn as
a pawnbroker,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>There were loud cries of &#8220;Order! order!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley stood up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone <i>dared</i> to speak of pawnbrokers!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff seized the tails of his coat:</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, let us have no fines to-night, Rippley&mdash;I&#8217;m
stone-broke&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She started&mdash;gave a shrill scream&mdash;and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious, boys! I forgot. I have to knock up some paragraphs
for <i>The Midnight Sun</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fumbled in the breast-pocket of her jacket, and lugged out a
note-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother!&#8221; said she; &#8220;what shall I write about?&#8221;</p>

<p>She licked the pencil, and cudgelled her genius, but nothing came
of it.</p>

<p>Rippley looked down upon her contemptuously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Blue Stephens! Emma,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you have no imagination.
<i>Brilliant Literary and Artistic Reception at Mr. Pangbutt&#8217;s!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; she bawled. &#8220;That&#8217;ll do, rippin&#8217;!... Someone
dictate, and I&#8217;ll write&#8221;&mdash;she looked round&mdash;&#8220;You, Lovegood! You
have the most gorgeous imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot agree with him who said that the flattery of woman has
no end,&#8221; he said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chuck epigram,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;and dictate, like a good chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>He set his gaze on the theme, and the great black brows met:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The select Conversazione in the spacious and brilliantly-lighted
rooms&mdash;of the&mdash;er&mdash;world-famous portrait-painter was attended
by&mdash;&mdash;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff held up her pencil:</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy all!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;<i>attended&mdash;by</i>&mdash;&mdash;All right. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens took up the dictation:</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;<i>by the √©lite of the fashionable world and the flower of Upper
Bohemia</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff&#8217;s pencil scratched down the addition:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Upper&mdash;Bohemia</i>,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Which idiot is writing this masterpiece, Emma? the fluffsome
Reubens or I?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Fluffy Reubens apologized:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so afraid that √©lite might be left out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Lovegood sadly, &#8220;that so old a friend should
think me so barren an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff looked up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chuck argument,&#8221; she said impatiently. &#8220;Go on, Lovegood!&#8221;</p>

<p>She licked her pencil invitingly:</p>

<p>Lovegood entered into his inspiration again:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The palatial rooms were resplendent with a hundred lights, and the
myriad glass lustres shone like stars above the well-bred Babel assembled
in this gorgeous modern palace. Amongst the witty throng mingled
eminent men&mdash;in the arts and the&mdash;er&mdash;liberal professions.</i>&#8221; He
coughed. &#8220;Aubrey represents the liberal professions&mdash;though he
rarely achieves his larger intentions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Lovegood&mdash;and dictate,&#8221; said Emma.</p>

<p>Lovegood sighed, and got back to his task:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>To say nothing of much beauty and fashion</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma simpered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Flatterer!&#8221; she said giddily.</p>

<p>Lovegood bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mr. Fosse, the English Maupassant, was to be seen flitting from
group to group, discoursing on the magnetism of style. Mr. Carver
Rippley, whose possible election to the Academy was the topic of much
speculation, explained away the motive of his coming masterpiece in
marble. Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A bottle-necked man with a shapeless head, colourless hair, and a
fat puffy underlip beneath a slovenly moustache slowly rose from a
chair.</p>

<p>Rippley flung himself upon him, punched him in the midriff, and
threw him back into his seat. Rippley&#8217;s brows were knit:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; said he, frowning at Lovegood&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t start
Quogge Myre talking. He always takes two columns of close print to
yield up an idea&mdash;and then it isn&#8217;t his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood chuckled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>A most pleasant evening showed Mr. Pangbutt to be not only a
man of mark in the fashionable world, but a brilliant and amusing
host&mdash;his loud, jolly laugh and gay camaraderie setting the keynote of
refined amusement to the distinguished party that poured through his
palatial rooms.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff looked up&mdash;the pencil on her lip:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all, you&#8217;ve left <i>me</i> out, Lovegood!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I distinctly mentioned beauty and fashion, Emma. But I will give
you the personal note: <i>Miss Hartroff was elegantly dressed in peau-de-suede
gloves of the latest colour</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley said &#8220;Naughty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mr. Aubrey, languidly witty, was the soul of poetry in motion.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a gentle snore.</p>

<p>Rippley held up a hand, motioning for silence:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;Ts-s-sh!&#8221; he hushed; and he added in a whisper: &#8220;Poetry
sleeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey was heavily asleep in his corner of the sofa; chin on chest,
his inert arms fallen listless by his sides.</p>

<p>Lovegood rose from his chair, and said in a low growl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Citizens, the republic of letters is again called upon to record its
august vote.&#8221; He pointed tragically to the sleeping beauty: &#8220;This
weary Affair that lies before you, its lank indecent limbs stretched in
such graceless attitude of repose, has once already, during this evening,
offended your eyes, insulted your intelligence, galled your ears, with
the declaiming of unasked-for verse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intolerable!&#8221; growled Rippley; and</p>

<p>&#8220;Intolerable!&#8221; growled they all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Rippley.</p>

<p>Lovegood pointed a scornful hand at the sleeping poet:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Thing stood up, stopped conversation, and&mdash;uttered indifferent
verse!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>They all shook their heads.</p>

<p>Lovegood&#8217;s pale face glowered upon them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a being, old before his time, usurping the wisdom of the
world&mdash;which were bad enough&mdash;but, worse still, offending your sight,
as citizen Rippley might say, by affecting the hair of decadence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Preposterous,&#8221; growled he&mdash;&#8220;cut it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>An angelic smile spread over the pale features of Eustace Lovegood:</p>

<p>&#8220;How great thought travels!&#8221; he said ecstatically&mdash;&#8220;how thought
begets thought!... Now that was precisely what flashed into my
thinking machinery. What? Scissors? Oh, ah, yes&mdash;materialistic
Emma always carries scissors. But the executioner! who is worthy
to clip the godlike locks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley stole over to Emma and took the scissors.</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Rippley! Thy subtle fingers, creating such blood-curdling
insignificances in clay, shall at last be used to noble ends&mdash;at last be
put to their originally designed calling of barber.&#8221; Rippley was
snipping off the hair with unskilful gashes, the severed locks falling
softly upon the floor. &#8220;Thou, Rippley, shalt make minor poetry
illustrious&mdash;thou shalt breathe notoriety into the nostrils of Aubrey&#8217;s
verse&mdash;thou shalt give him through a success of scandal what his rhymes
can never bring him&mdash;a grip on the skirts of Fame. Since Fame his
verse can never bring him, he shall flirt with her through Infamy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley held up a lock:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone else have some?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Lovegood chuckled ironically:</p>

<p>&#8220;But shear the glory from him tenderly, deftly,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not cutting a hedge. Set aside each lock that falls, that the hero-worshipper
may wear a snippet from a poet&#8217;s brow.... All the dear
delightful barmaids will want a lock. Peckham tea-parties will thrill
at the touch of it&mdash;Clapham culture sob&mdash;West Kensington be troubled.
And in the town I can hear all the little coffee-girls a-weeping....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Pan is not dead. The news is worse than that&mdash;Pan is growing bald
and middle-aged.... Poets should be heard, not seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley dropped the scissors and whipped into a seat, uttering a
smothered guffaw, as Aubrey roused and yawned.</p>

<p>Lovegood sat down:</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;the sleeping beauty wakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poet opened his eyes drowsily, and rose slowly, sleepily, from
the sofa, amidst a tense silence.</p>

<p>As he stood up, his hair raggedly clipped about his head, making
his long neck inordinately naked, a titter ran round the guests.</p>

<p>He shivered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreamed,&#8221; he said; and ran his hand over his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreamed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran his hand over his hair again.</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff got up from her seat and, thrusting her hands into
her pockets, she straddled before him, gazing at him.</p>

<p>His eyes were staring blankly into space.</p>

<p>She tittered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m blowed!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;Modern Poetry seems to be all
rhymes and neckties.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poet burst into tears.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>

<p>For a month the boy Noll lay seriously ill; but at last his young
body began to gain vigour, and strength slowly to come back to him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Master Oliver is convinced that it is Difficult to play the
Man&#8217;s Part on a Weak Stomach</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a large attic the glow of a stove, that roared of warmth, gave a
sense of comfort to the spacious, rambling, rather bare room; and
from its opened iron door the ruddy light of its furnace flared cheerily
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Near by sat Caroline Baddlesmere at a small table, where a shaded
lamp flung down a golden glory upon the white pages of the printer&#8217;s
proofs she was correcting, reflecting little amber lights that played
about her handsome eye-pits and nostrils and mouth and chin.</p>

<p>Along the low walls, almost to where the steep roof met them, books
were piled for lack of shelves; and the largeness of the room and the
atmosphere of the books gave the suggestion of a library that was
strangely at variance with a small bed in the far end of the large place,
where a candle dimly showed the boy Oliver lying amongst his
pillows, watching Netherby Gomme and Julia as they whispered their
confidences seated on chairs hard by him. The candle&#8217;s light painted
their faces picturesquely against the black hollow of an open doorway
that led to a smaller attic which was the Baddlesmeres&#8217; sleeping-room.
Eyes grown accustomed to this gloom might have seen that a thin
line of blue smoke curled upwards from the bed, for Noll was colouring
the wedding-present&mdash;keeping a sharp look-out lest anyone should see
him, and raising a screen of bedclothes with his knees, between himself
and detection....</p>

<p>Caroline roused from her work, disturbed by the loud sniff of a
shabby little maid-of-all-work who entered the room, a dusting-brush
under her arm and a dusting-rag in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, lidy,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;may I finish a bit of work by the
light of the stove?&mdash;I won&#8217;t be more than four-and-twenty shakes, and
I&#8217;ll be very quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline nodded good-humouredly.</p>

<p>The lank child&mdash;she was little more&mdash;stooped down by the blaze of
warm light that came from the stove&#8217;s open door, and lugging a
battered periodical out of her pocket, smoothed it out and began to
read....</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Victoria May Alice?&#8221; asked Caroline, after a
while, smiling at the calm effrontery of the girl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Victoria May Alice uttered a loud sniff:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just a-finishing this here chapter, lidy&mdash;it&#8217;s so blamey dark
on the landing. I&#8217;d got to such a beautiful part&mdash;where Sir &#8217;Enery
Marjorrybanks is a-telling of the lady&#8217;s-maid as her eyes is so magical
and is just a-seein&#8217; of poems in their liquid depths, and all that....
It give me a kind of nice hump the way they was a-goin&#8217; hon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you reading, Victoria May Alice?&#8221; Caroline held out
her hand. &#8220;Let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smudgy little maid handed her the periodical:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>Bow Bells</i>, marm&mdash;what that rummy gent brings me&mdash;him
what they calls Lovegood.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went and stood beside her chair as Caroline looked at the
paper; and with long bony fingers, not very clean, the girl proceeded
to do the honours:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the picture of Sir &#8217;Enery a-kissin&#8217; of the girl hunder the
hoak-tree. She&#8217;s purtendin&#8217; she don&#8217;t like it. I wonder why they
always does that in high-class society. I kissed a &#8217;airdresser once,
and it was better than a lobster salad&mdash;but (<i>sniff</i>) that&#8217;s neither
&#8217;ere nor there.... I like them wonderful whiskers of Sir&#8217;&#8217;Enery
Marjorrybanks&mdash;I like &#8217;is name, too, it&#8217;s like crackin&#8217; nuts&mdash;Marjorrybanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marchbanks, Victoria!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice looked hard at the handsome lady before her,
suspiciously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Garn, mem!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re coddin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile flickered about the corners of Caroline&#8217;s mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said severely&mdash;&#8220;you must believe me, Victoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Victoria May Alice&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll allow I most generally
does. But if that there don&#8217;t spell Marjorrybanks I&#8217;ll darn my
stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;Victoria May Alice will have to darn her
stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice considered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mem,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;I takes back the stockin&#8217;s. I dessay you&#8217;re
right.&#8221; She put her head on one side and surveyed the difficulty with
one eye half shut.... She sighed: &#8220;All I can say is that it ain&#8217;t the
way <i>we</i> was taught to spell at the board-school. But I suppose it&#8217;s all
right. I reckon it&#8217;s high-toned and hupper-class to spell things as
they ain&#8217;t got no reason to be spelled. There was a lady here quite
recent as was callin&#8217; on the first floor as is given to indulgence&#8221; She
tippled with an imaginary glass of wine. &#8220;And this party as was
callin&#8217; on the one as is given to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Victoria,&#8221; said Caroline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>you</i> know&mdash;well, she was a-doin&#8217; of the thing regular formal
and in style, I can tell you, powdered footman and a red-nosed geezer
with white leather breeches a-sittin&#8217; on the coachman&#8217;s box, and all&mdash;well,
she rings the bell in the old party&#8217;s room as&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;and in
I hustles, a-doin&#8217; up my bun on the back of my &#8217;ead with my &#8217;and as
I stood at the door. She asked for her broom. &#8216;Yes, lidy,&#8217; says I, and
takes her one up from the kitchen. But she was that short, you&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
think I&#8217;d hit her on the bonnet!... What d&#8217;you think she was
gettin&#8217; at?... Why&mdash;her bloomin&#8217; brow-ham!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice, in the attitude of a coachman on his box, and
with mighty clucks and &#8220;gees&#8221; and &#8220;whoas,&#8221; whipped up imaginary
horses.</p>

<p>A shrill voice called from far below:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria&mdash;May&mdash;Yall&mdash;liss!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little maid-of-all-work went out of the door, and, leaning over
the balustrade, she called down the stairs at the top pitch of her shrill
voice, standing a-tiptoe to give her lean lungs full play:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;marm! I&#8217;m a-com&mdash;ing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She came back into the room, and added placidly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ate &#8217;er voice. It goes through yer like a gimlet.... But
(sniff) she ain&#8217;t bad&mdash;not all through&mdash;when you knows &#8217;er.&#8221; She
sniffed.</p>

<p>The shrill voice came mounting up the stairs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria&mdash;May&mdash;Yall&mdash;liss!&#8221;</p>

<p>The untidy child stepped quickly back to the door, and putting out
her head through the cranny, yelled, with sing-song delivery:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Yes</i>&mdash;marm!&mdash;I&#8217;m a-comin&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;a-coming! The top floor&#8217;s
a-wantin&#8217; coals hasty, marm; and a-gettin&#8217; nasty about the size of
the scuttles!&#8221;</p>

<p>She came blithely into the room, and, screwing up her mouth, said,
with a wise nod of the head:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one on the tender for &#8217;er!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline suppressed a smile, and said reprovingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I made no complaint about the size of the coal-scuttles, Victoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice sniffed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lor bless yer, no,&#8221; said she; &#8220;but them coal-scuttles is what I calls
a vegitable halloocination.... You ain&#8217;t one to complain; but it&#8217;s
about time some one did it for yer.... My word, she do run it fine
with them egg-cups o&#8217; coal! She don&#8217;t dare let <i>me</i> fill the bucket&mdash;so
I gets off that job!&#8221; Sniff.</p>

<p>Caroline sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Victoria, she has to practise economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice nodded her head seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some kinds of economy as is religion, and some kinds as
is against religion, mem,&#8221; said she. &#8220;She&#8217;s always talking of savin&#8217;
for that blackguard son of hers in Australia.&#8221; She came near to
Caroline Baddlesmere and added in a hoarse whisper&mdash;&#8220;My solemn
opinion is the feller is doin&#8217; his five years&#8217; hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, Victoria&mdash;you are descending to scandal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am&mdash;and again, perhaps I ain&#8217;t. Who&#8217;d be writing to
her from Wormwood Scrubbs Prison but her own relations&mdash;garn!
D&#8217;yer think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now, Victoria!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria prepared to depart, but hesitated at the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;If Master Oliver&#8217;s a-wantin&#8217; of anythink, lady, jest you put yer &#8217;ead
over the rail and &#8217;owl for it,&#8221; said she. Loud sniff. &#8220;It&#8217;s no good
being backward and modest in this &#8217;ouse&mdash;nor, for that, in this dirty
city.... They&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>There was a furious ringing of a bell below, and the racket was
followed by an irritable yell:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria&mdash;May&mdash;Yall&mdash;liss!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice sniffed:</p>

<p>&#8220;My eye!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;she&#8217;ll thump my &#8217;ed when I go down!&#8221; And
yelling where she stood: &#8220;Yes&mdash;marm&mdash;I&#8217;m a-coming!&#8221; she turned
to Caroline and added in a confidential whisper: &#8220;No, lidy&mdash;it&#8217;s no
gain being backward and modest. <i>She</i> don&#8217;t understand it, bless
yer. Thinks you&#8217;re weak&mdash;or can&#8217;t pay yer bill. And, bless yer,
lidy, I don&#8217;t a-mind a-carryin&#8217; up of the scuttles&mdash;not to <i>this</i> floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline nodded anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Run along, Victoria, like a good girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lidy,&#8221; said she. Loud sniff.</p>

<p>As she turned to go she caught sight of Noll smoking in bed. She
smuggled a laugh into her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ridic&#8217;lous little creature,&#8221; said she, and disappeared. The
door softly shut after her, and her weary young feet could be heard
shuffling down the stairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Julia,&#8221; said Noll, from his bed&mdash;&#8220;ain&#8217;t it time we had a
meal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere looked up:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some bread soaked in milk for you, Noll&mdash;on the table. I
will heat it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s stomach turned against it. He shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid, mother, I can&#8217;t eat it,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline, rising calmly, put on her cloak and hat and let herself out
of the room. She said she would soon be back....</p>

<p>Netherby leaned forward, chin in hand, and gazed at Julia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julia,&#8221; he said, in a low whisper, &#8220;look how these people face
poverty and neglect&mdash;just because they have each other to work for.
Why cannot we, you and I, start life together&mdash;now&mdash;to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Netherby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her slender fingers in his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear girl,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I am now known a little. The money
will be coming in soon. What more would you wait for?... Must
I bring you the moon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But supposing I drag you down, Netherby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Julia&mdash;you talk as if you were sixteen stone, and I swimming
in a duck-pond. We can never be in want from now&mdash;not more
than we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you be sure, Netherby?&#8221;</p>

<p>His stern face smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can amuse the world. And the world cheerfully flings its pence
to its jesters. On the blackest night the court fool may warm his
hands at the hearth of the world. And I once heard the greatest ass
in London confess that it takes a clever fellow to be reckoned a
remarkable fool in these days, Julia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This disaster to Caroline and Mr. Anthony has frightened me,&#8221;
she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has strengthened me,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;given me courage. Here are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
gently nurtured people, used to the luxuries of life, whose womenfolk
wear the bonnet of fashion without a strut, for they have never known
any other; here they are, living all hugger-mugger in a &#8220;spacious
upper floor&#8221; where even I, from the ranks, would be everlastingly
seeing only the faults&mdash;yet never so much as a whimper from them.
They are as cheery as though they had come into the family estates.
Until the boy went sick, Baddlesmere was never more amusing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&mdash;they laugh to keep the tears away,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my Julia, you would not have them live their life in one
long-drawn-out fear lest the world be full of fears!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;how do you know your next book will be a success,
Netherby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, dear. I once knew a man who was so afraid of
getting a chill that he wore goloshes after sunset&mdash;he died of heat-apoplexy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy Noll yawned:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Netherby,&#8221; he grumbled from the bed peevishly: &#8220;come
here, you and Julia, and sit on the bed&mdash;I can&#8217;t hear a word you say&mdash;it&#8217;s
so beastly dull seeing you billing and cooing there and missing all
the letterpress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby chuckled hugely; and they both got up, he chuckling, and
she blushing, and came to the boy&#8217;s bedside. Noll was looking very
sickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Noll,&#8221; said Julia in alarm&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you ought not to be
smoking. You are looking so pale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shush!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;or mother&#8217;ll hear you.... I got back the
pipe from that sailor fellow&mdash;I told him I couldn&#8217;t pay him because I had
had money losses. He waived the fee&mdash;he said that though he commanded
a barge he&#8217;d colour a dozen meerschaum pipes for a good un
like me, free of cost&mdash;I had only to send along the pipes and the
tobacco. Such a gentlemanly fellow, he was! Though a bit dirty....
Thames sailors are such warm-hearted johnnies&mdash;but they don&#8217;t
keep their nails very nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Noll,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;you ought not to be sitting up in bed
without your jacket on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought the lad his short black jacket, and he submitted to
putting it on graciously enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;surely you cannot get any pleasure from
smoking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Julia,&#8221; he said limply&mdash;&#8220;I shall never get the pipe
coloured in time for your wedding if you go on like this.... Unless
you put it off for a little.... You see, I&#8217;m not very used to a pipe&mdash;and
I don&#8217;t mind telling you it does make my head go round a bit.
But&mdash;hullo! I say, hold my pipe, Julia&mdash;there&#8217;s a whopping great
moth!&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the pipe to Julia, who took it reluctantly enough; he
jumped up, and, seizing a butterfly net which hung over a chest of
drawers by his bed-head, he leaped about on his tumbled bed in his
night-shirt, Eton jacket, and black stockings, making frantic sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
at the fluttering moth, which swerved aside, escaped the net, and
fluttered through the dark doorway into the next room. Noll leaped
from his bed and made after it, in hot pursuit, chasing it into the
gloom of the dark room beyond.</p>

<p>Julia sighed&mdash;put aside the pipe with dainty fingers of disgust&mdash;and
sat down again.</p>

<p>They could hear Noll fumbling about in the next room.</p>

<p>Netherby went and sat beside her.</p>

<p>He watched her in silence for awhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Julia,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;promise. You must promise. Promise&mdash;promise&mdash;promise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They both started.</p>

<p>Through the open doorway came the boy, looking like misery,
deathly pale, and dragging the butterfly-net limply after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;O lor!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Noll!&#8221; said Julia&mdash;&#8220;what on earth have you been doing
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll halted wearily before them:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that sailor-man&#8217;s tobacco,&#8221; he said gloomily. &#8220;It was&mdash;too
much&mdash;for&mdash;my strength. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a man&mdash;yet....
Netherby, you and Julia can get married as soon as you like&mdash;I shall
never smoke again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid the butterfly-net on Gomme&#8217;s knees, and added, with a wan
smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Netherby, let&#8217;s change places&mdash;you go and catch butterflies
whilst I kiss Julia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julia jumped and uttered a little scream:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Noll, you cruel boy&mdash;you&#8217;ve caught the moth!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>She put her deft fingers into the net, caught the struggling thing,
and, taking it out carefully, carried it to the window and let it fly out
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Noll smiled gloomily at Netherby:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very cruel of Julia,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s a beastly night&mdash;that
moth&#8217;ll get an awful cold in its chest&mdash;accompanied by sore throat,
fever, and chills, and violent perspiration&mdash;and developing into a
nasty hacking cough.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Master Oliver entertains Guests</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Caroline Baddlesmere returned to the great bare room, and
took off her outdoor wraps, Noll was seemingly drowsing, Netherby
Gomme sitting on the bed by his side.</p>

<p>The boy had been lying very still for awhile when he touched
Netherby&#8217;s sleeve, signing to him to put down the ear of confidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Netherby,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;when it&#8217;s within a quarter of midnight,
old Modeyne will be fumbling at the door-latch down below.... I
shan&#8217;t be able to help Betty to bring him up to-night&mdash;so you might
slip down on tip-toe and just keep a flight of steps above her all the
way. In case she needs help you can pretend you are just going
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took hold of Gomme&#8217;s coat-lapel:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let her know you are on the look-out unless old Modeyne is
very far gone&mdash;he&#8217;s a goodish weight to push along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby nodded.</p>

<p>A gleam shot into Noll&#8217;s eye; and he caught Gomme&#8217;s coat-lapel
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;He comes up pretty quiet&mdash;he always takes his boots off <i>for fear of
waking the gossips</i>!&#8221; A twinkle glittered in his eyes: &#8220;The bother
is that once he begins undressing he takes off everything but his shirt,
and insists on going to sleep on the hall mat. Betty has got to keep
him moving&mdash;she knows exactly what to do.... Once he starts up
the stairs he is all right&mdash;unless he hiccups, and insists on apologizing
to the people whose doors he is passing.... You&#8217;ll know soon
enough, he nearly kicks their doors down. He looks killingly funny
with his braces hanging down behind and carrying his boots and
things as he goes crawling up the stairs, cracking his toes, and complaining
that <i>it is not seemly that rending Hiccup should climb the
Whirling Stairs of Ambition</i>. He sometimes lies down at the head
of a flight of steps and insists on going to sleep&mdash;he says that <i>we are
the slaves of convention, and an overplus of clips tends to an overtax of
sleep</i>.... You&#8217;ve got to see that he doesn&#8217;t stop at the landlady&#8217;s
door, or he&#8217;ll kick it and chuckle in a loud whisper: <i>Behold where
whispering gossip lies!</i> with the accent on the &#8216;lies.&#8217; He&#8217;s a bit of
a wag is old Modeyne; but he won&#8217;t do anything low&mdash;he&#8217;s always a
gentleman&mdash;even in his night-shirt.&#8221; The lad&#8217;s face grew serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
again. &#8220;Betty will be waiting up for him&mdash;and she has no fire&mdash;and&mdash;I
shall not be able to help to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby nodded.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door; and the little lodging-house drudge
crept in, shut it after her, and set her back against it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, lidy,&#8221; she said with a loud sniff, &#8220;that lidy what walks like
a police-officer is a-straddlin&#8217; on the mat outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>She jerked her thumb over her shoulder towards the door behind
her:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgot her name,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve showed her up, because
it&#8217;s such a leg-aching grind a-goin&#8217; down and up them stairs twice&mdash;but
I&#8217;ll show her down again if yer don&#8217;t want to be bothered with her&mdash;and
Master Oliver all of a heap too!... I did give her a hint as it was
the small-pox likely enough&mdash;and I can easy work up the idea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The gift was pushed forward by the door opening behind her, and
Emma Hartroff entered the room, her hands thrust in the side-pockets
of her long jacket.</p>

<p>She greeted Caroline breezily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mrs. Baddlesmere&mdash;how are you all?... I could hear
every word the little slavey said.... I thought I might come and
worry Noll a bit&mdash;may I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline had risen, and came forward to greet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Hartroff&mdash;of course you may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad&mdash;I was so afraid they&#8217;d send me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline, as she shook hands, whispered to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;If he show signs of drowsiness, please let him go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff bowed an answer, and strode over to Noll&#8217;s bed;
she nodded to the others, who made way for her, and taking her
straddling stand near him, she surveyed the boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>do</i> look pretty sick, on my word, Noll,&#8221; said she; and added
pathetically: &#8220;I wish I could do something for you&mdash;I never know
what to do with kids; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Emma,&#8221; said Noll&mdash;&#8220;you ain&#8217;t going to a children&#8217;s party,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff raised eyebrows of inquiry:</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no, Noll!&#8221;</p>

<p>He signed to her to sit down beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t play the snivelling mother,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;it ain&#8217;t your size.
Come and flirt with <i>me</i>&mdash;you may hold my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emma Hartroff laughed good-naturedly, and sitting down on the
bed beside the boy, she took his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, you are very old,&#8221; she said&mdash;and she blew a breath:
&#8220;Phooh! you <i>are</i> high up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he nodded&mdash;&#8220;it makes me quite giddy when I smoke a pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>A knock at the door&mdash;and the little drudge skipped in and shut it
again. She strode down the room on tip-toe to Caroline:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, lidy&mdash;here&#8217;s that rummy gent as speaks like them beautiful
play-actors. He&#8217;s waitin&#8217; to see you very partic&#8217;lar.&#8221; She giggled.
&#8220;He&#8217;s such a funny gentleman! Excuse my laughin&#8217;, mum, but he is
that hodd and ridic&#8217;lous! When I opened the door he says, says he:
&#8216;Hail, lugubrious smudgy serving-wench!&#8217; says he.&#8221; She uttered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sniff, and cocked her head thoughtfully: &#8220;I expect he&#8217;s a poet or that
sort of party. Jimmy, what a rum tailor he has! But if you ask me,
mum, he knows how to spell hungry. I knows a man&#8217;s eyes when he&#8217;s
short of his victuals. I ought ter.&#8221; Sniff. &#8220;I do love the the-ayter.
They talks so beautiful&mdash;just as if words had meanin&#8217; in them. Not
a bit like real people&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask what the gentleman is doing, meanwhile?&#8221; asked
Caroline drily.</p>

<p>The girl leaned forward, and added confidentially behind the back
of her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on the mat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She jerked her thumb at the door.</p>

<p>Caroline shifted uneasily in her chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would call gentlemen by their names, Victoria May
Alice,&#8221; she said irritably. &#8220;Do you mean Mr. Eustace Lovegood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8217;im,&#8221; said Victoria May Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then show him in, you stupid child.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of Victoria May Alice cleared. She strode theatrically to
the door, flung it open like a footman, and, suppressing a spluttered
guffaw, announced mock-heroically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Eustace Lovegood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood walked in tragically&mdash;halted before Victoria May Alice,
and put his hand on her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria May Alice,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you will never do for the
Embassy. You do not take the world seriously. When you announce
genius you must shout it fearlessly, as though you had thrust a benefit
upon the world&mdash;not as though you were hurriedly hiding away
undarned stockings in a coffee canister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice muffled a snigger in her hands and skipped from
the room.</p>

<p>Lovegood turned to his hostess:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Caroline!&#8221; He advanced down the room slowly: &#8220;Your
devoted slave&mdash;Noll&#8217;s devoted slave! Ha! Mr. Gomme, your servant!
Miss Julia! I am your footstool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline rose to meet him. She smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;You wished to see me, Eustace!&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to see if Noll were well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She made as though she would lead him to the boy&#8217;s bedside:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do Noll good just to see you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The big man held her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear Caroline&mdash;I come for my own pleasure, not for his.
Noll being ill, the town seems unholy quiet. History is an empty
tragedy without its historian&mdash;an epic less than doggerel without its
poet. And the town, being bereft of Noll, has ceased to be moved
with incident. The world is become a dead-house. What an eye a
boy has for calamities! He scents an event in the air. He arrives
before the accident. A boy is always thrilled at the sight of a powder-cask&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, Eustace, you were not always throwing lighted matches so
near the cask.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>The great fellow laughed jovially, and kissing her hand, he strode
over to the bed where Noll lay, his eyes upon him. The greetings
were very cordial. There had always been the alliance of understanding
between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said Lovegood, sitting down on the bed at his feet&mdash;&#8220;dear
boy, I am not well versed in the teething of infants, the lacy mysteries
of long-clothes, the cooing garrulities of the cradle, but&mdash;I <i>was</i> once a
<i>boy</i>.... I remember the emotional moments of boyhood.... I
have never forgotten my first pork-pie.... I would fain have brought
you a rare roast goose, Oliver; but I had to decide on the homely
chicken broth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ho, without!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A-coming!&#8221; cried, from without, the shrill voice of Victoria May
Alice.</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and there entered Victoria, carrying a
smoking bowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria May Alice,&#8221; said Lovegood&mdash;&#8220;bear the goblet to the
king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice bore the goblet.</p>

<p>She handed the bowl to Noll&mdash;spluttered into a guffaw behind a
grimy hand&mdash;and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>The big man, sitting at the foot of the bed, smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, Oliver,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;and get well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll began to sup the fragrant broth with a spoon.</p>

<p>Lovegood got up from the bed&mdash;coughed&mdash;blew his nose.</p>

<p>Caroline caught his eye, and signed to him. He strode down the
room to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eustace,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wish you would not spend your money on
the boy. You have no right to stint yourself&mdash;but&mdash;my dear fellow,
you touch my heart&mdash;and&mdash;I cannot scold you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stroked her shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! nonsense!&#8221; said he, &#8220;we must not grow sentimental
before we are forty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He was interrupted by the click of the door,
and, looking round, found Victoria May Alice at his elbow. She said
to Caroline:</p>

<p>&#8220;My heye, mum, we is a-makin&#8217; of a night of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood laughed and strode back to his seat on Noll&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>Caroline turned impatiently to the girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Victoria&mdash;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice sniffed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t <i>it</i>, mum&mdash;it&#8217;s <i>them</i>,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;two of them comic gentlemen,&#8221;
she tittered, and pulled herself up behind a grimy hand&mdash;&#8220;as is
always a-hangin&#8217; about with the party from the the-ayter.&#8221; She jerked
a thumb at Lovegood. &#8220;They&#8217;re on the &#8217;all doorstep and says is
Master Noll at &#8217;ome to partic&#8217;lar friends&mdash;and I says I&#8217;ll go and see;
but if they was a-comin&#8217; into this blessed house they&#8217;ve got to put out
them dirty pipes. It&#8217;s not nice of them a-callin&#8217; on the gentry a-smokin&#8217;
that muck. I don&#8217;t like it. These here London people has no
manners. They wouldn&#8217;t do it if they was callin&#8217; on a duchess or a
bandy-legged bishop, or people as keep a butler. But&mdash;they are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ridic&#8217;lous! Specially that&mdash;te-hee!&mdash;fluffy gentleman. Blime me&mdash;if
I don&#8217;t go on to the the-ayter myself when I&#8217;m grown up. I calls
that Life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped at the clatter of feet on the attic stairs:</p>

<p>&#8220;O lor!&#8221; she said resignedly&mdash;&#8220;here they comes, bless &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline put out her hand and touched the girl&#8217;s arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria, my dear child, don&#8217;t be so noisy, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, lidy,&#8221; the child replied humbly, and with sepulchral
hoarseness.</p>

<p>There was a loud knock, and before there was time to answer it,
Rippley and Robbins boisterously entered the room.</p>

<p>Noll&#8217;s greetings were too boyish for whispered talk as they all found
seats.</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice winked at Fluffy Reubens.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He</i> ain&#8217;t dead yet!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Caroline had scarcely returned to her work, when Victoria May Alice
stepped stealthily to her side:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fosse called just before these gentlemen, mum,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;The silly hass wouldn&#8217;t take no for an answer, so I says, &#8216;Well, it&#8217;s
scarlet fever if you will have it between yer bleery bicycle lamps,&#8217;
says I.&#8221; She put her lean little arms akimbo: &#8220;He&#8217;s so blimey
pushing.&#8221; She put her hand up to her mouth and added confidentially:
&#8220;I can&#8217;t abide Fosse myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A distant yell from below called: &#8220;Victoria-May-Yallis!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;there&#8217;s &#8217;er voice a-yellin&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stole away softly.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Egoism begins to Suspect that there is a Bottom to the
Pint Pot</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Please,</span> mum,&#8221; Victoria&#8217;s untidy head appeared round the edge of
the door, whispering hoarsely: &#8220;A gentleman as calls hisself Pangbutt
is on the hall mat downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline raised her head inquiringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Paul Pangbutt?&#8221; she asked in frank surprise.</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice nodded violently:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the gent, mum&mdash;he said as you&#8217;d know his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say I am not at home to visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, mum&mdash;but he says as I was to say as he is partic&#8217;lar anxious
to see you. He called before&mdash;but he was that blimey gloomy I sent
him off for a walk&mdash;said as you wouldn&#8217;t be in for an hour&mdash;Lord
&#8217;elp me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Show Mr. Pangbutt upstairs, Victoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice dropped her dust-pan and brush with a rattle of
surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;you <i>will</i> see him.... Bless yer, <i>I</i> thought he&#8217;d be a
gloomy nuisance&mdash;he&#8217;s that solemn. I told him he hadn&#8217;t a charnce.
He rather calls for a sunshiny day to show him off, does Pangbutt.&#8221;
She came in and leaned forward toward Caroline: &#8220;Don&#8217;t yer hesitate
to say a hint, mum&mdash;I&#8217;d lie like Sapphira, if yer tips the wink. I was
a-putting of him off anyway&mdash;I&#8217;ve been a-hinting as you was in your
bath, mum, but, of course, if yer <i>want</i> to see him, I&#8217;ll tell him it was
all shine and on second thoughts you ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to have one
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl went to the head of the stairs, rattled the tin dust-pan
against the brush handle to call the visitor&#8217;s attention down below,
and cried shrilly over the balustrade:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! mister&mdash;you can come up all right&mdash;it&#8217;s all off about the
bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her untidy head in at the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a-comin&#8217; up, lidy,&#8221; she said; and, shutting the door,
departed.</p>

<p>Caroline sighed wearily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could suppress that child,&#8221; she said....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>The door opened and Victoria May Alice, in the gloom beyond the
lamp, cried, as a dark figure entered the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman as says he&#8217;s Mr. Pangbutt, marm!&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of laughter came from the group about the bed at some
passing sally from Noll.</p>

<p>Paul Pangbutt, blinking at the lamp-light, looked dazedly round the
room.</p>

<p>Caroline rose from her seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Pangbutt!&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed to him formally, and added airily:</p>

<p>&#8220;So the river of life brings us together again in strange places!&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to meet her haltingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I particularly wished to see you&mdash;alone,&#8221; he said in a low tone and
with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>She bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have drifted along such different ways,&#8221; she said coldly,
&#8220;that I could scarcely believe the little servant when she told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to see if I could be of any help,&#8221; he said, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>She laughed lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Help?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice rose in gay surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you needed help,&#8221; he said, &#8220;nearly a month ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;no. But won&#8217;t you be seated?&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the stove and gazed at it&mdash;rebuffed&mdash;perplexed.</p>

<p>Caroline resumed her seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are settled in London at last!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hear nearly a
year now.... You see you are quite a celebrity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from the group about the bed made him start&mdash;and
he glanced suspiciously over his shoulder.</p>

<p>But they were oblivious of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Caroline,&#8221; he said hoarsely, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t wound me
more than my own miserable thoughts have been doing for these
many days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us have no talk of help,&#8221; she said, dropping her voice
also. &#8220;Anthony has got some night-work on the papers at last. We
are at the end of the siege. Besides&mdash;how do you know I am not on
the eve of another masterpiece?&#8221; She laughed&mdash;a little sadly. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t judge me too closely by my gowns&mdash;they are a little out of the
fashion, beyond a doubt, but we may blossom again next spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a chair, a poor rickety piece of furniture, before the stove,
and sat down upon it.</p>

<p>She smiled as it struck her how, unconsciously, he had, even in a
troubled state of mind, taken the warmest place in the room. He sat
for some while, gazing drearily into the furnace.</p>

<p>She wished he would say his say, and let her get back to her work.</p>

<p>At last he spoke in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Caroline, you and Anthony are the true artists&mdash;I only a fair-weather
one.... I have always dreaded the attic. I never could
put aside discomfort.... Anthony was quite right&mdash;I am painting
the most soulless things.... They pay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>She felt relieved. Anthony had evidently not gone with his hat in
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;we do not yearn for the attic heights precisely,&#8221; she said
drily.</p>

<p>He let the flippancy pass. He was too interested in himself to
trouble about their tastes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too successful,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure it isn&#8217;t best so,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;for you can help the
struggling ones to live&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stab me with that weapon&#8221;&mdash;he winced&mdash;&#8220;it is just exactly
what I have forgotten to do.&#8221; And he added half to himself: &#8220;Fame
has been my very God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loud laughter filled the room.</p>

<p>Noll yawned drowsily at the far end of the attic.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how <i>do</i> you tickle a trout?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Caroline repressed a desire to laugh.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Paul&mdash;you still worship at the old shrine&mdash;Fame, Posterity, and
all the Clap-Trap!... After all, the ages have their own intellectuals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think we should wholly neglect posterity,&#8221; he said
largely. He was deft in throwing the catchpenny. &#8220;We ought, if
we paint a great picture, to paint it with colours that will not
decay.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled sadly, flipped over some proofs, and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>All language dies, giving birth to other. Colour fades&mdash;paint
perishes, marble crumbles, the statue falls in the grass, the glowing
harmonies pass into blackness and are no more, the rains wash the
hand&#8217;s craft from the hardest stone&mdash;the cathedral, the masonry of
which, splendidly upspringing to the clouds, reaches towards the swinging
skies, crumbles at last and falls and sinks into the gutter&mdash;is
carried grain by grain in drainage of runnels to the water-brook, or
by babbling brook in rounded pebbles into the sea of obliterate things.
That literary works die, as all human effort dies, is a part of the pathos
of the unattainable&mdash;a part of the grim tribute of Life to Death. In the
life of the world, Homer is but of the day before yesterday, and he is
dead except to a few scholars; even Shakespeare himself, who is but of
yesterday, is read and known by how few of those who utter so glibly
the fragments of his wisdom! There is no finality in literature&mdash;no
end to art. The sweetest love-lyric will one day sound scholastic,
pattered by lips that, for all their essaying, cannot taste its native
tenderness&mdash;sounded in ears that will be deaf to some subtle accent of
it&mdash;heard by alien minds that must strain by grammar and rule of
thumb to catch its meaning, which the very shepherds of its living day
could grasp at its mere uttering. But noble work, even though it pass
away, gives birth to nobler, as the heroic act ceases at the breathing
of a breath, yet lives in the remembering; and we should be content
indeed to enrich and strengthen the spirit of our age.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat for awhile, after her voice had ceased; and, with puckered
brows, stared at the light:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;I have worked only for Fame,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have shut out the
world&mdash;turned a deaf ear to its pain and cry&mdash;toiled and striven for
Fame alone. And I have won it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have found a pretty dry biscuit to feed your heart upon,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>He nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have awaked to find myself alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was laughing applause by the bed.</p>

<p>Caroline smiled sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have been a little lonely, eh, Paul?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am finding myself more and more alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another gust of laughter from the group about the
bed.</p>

<p>Pangbutt looked round uneasily.</p>

<p>The sphinx smile came to Caroline&#8217;s lips; she saw his uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;there are too many ghosts in your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts?&#8221; he asked moodily. He nodded after awhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there <i>are</i> ghosts,&#8221; he said bitterly.</p>

<p>She leaned forward:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Paul&mdash;when the twilight comes, and the day&#8217;s work is set
aside, all the colours turn to drab&mdash;and the ghosts of dead friendships
and dead follies come out and walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He uttered a low bitter laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet there are they that are jealous because I am famous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughter burst into the room.</p>

<p>Pangbutt moved uneasily:</p>

<p>&#8220;How oddly those men laugh!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are grown suspicious, Paul&mdash;they are not even thinking of us....
Every nudge at the elbow is not Envy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt sighed, and turned his eyes inwards again towards the man
who interested him most:</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I have been living in a fools&#8217;
paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline&#8217;s eyes hardened:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are worse things than a fools&#8217; paradise,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The
man who lives for himself alone may awake one day to find himself
in a mad-house&mdash;one with all the other ghosts that flit about his
prison&mdash;a shadow amongst shadows, seeking shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shadow?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;A shadow, Paul.... There is no woman in your life&mdash;no child&mdash;no
care but for self. What does a childless, mateless man know of
life? He has not taken up its most initial gifts. He avoids its
responsibilities, its risks, its pains, its debt to God and man. Why
should he expect, or even hope for, the joys of life? Who can know
real delight who shirks the winning&mdash;or who shall find happiness that
shrinks from sorrows?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I become a part of the crowd?&#8221; he asked with
contempt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;You cannot turn your back on your fellows&mdash;unless you are to grow
an orchard of dead-sea apples,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He sat silent for awhile.</p>

<p>He gazed perplexedly at his ambitions:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made a career&mdash;have won its prizes. Until to-night I
considered myself an object of envy.... I <i>am</i> an object of
envy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Better be a microbe than a loveless man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;but at the sight of his wrecked self-esteem falling
about his wretched hunched shoulders the laughter left her eyes.</p>

<p>She leaned forward:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; she said.... &#8220;As I sat here some days ago, I could
have shrieked with terror&mdash;lest I should lose my boy. But I would
rather go mad with such fear than never have known the possibility
of it&mdash;than be as you are.... And for what? What is this Fame?
Who gives it? Who are these demi-gods who award it?... They
don&#8217;t even know their own minds for a generation&mdash;sometimes not for
a year.... Supposing this Fame, then, to which you are giving
your life, be <i>nothing</i> at all!&#8221; She laughed sadly. &#8220;But we are
getting quite serious,&#8221; she said; and rising to her feet she put her
hand on his stooped shoulders: &#8220;Paul,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;you are in love
with a sad flirt&mdash;I should be ungallant, and break off the engagement.
A woman could treat you no worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul rose, realizing his dismissal:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, Caroline, old friend,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;it is very late&mdash;I must
be going.... You make me think of the old days when you
kept us all in order in Paris.... Good-night! It is so long
since anybody took sufficient interest in me to rate me.... Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved towards the door, saying as he went:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go and sit with my ghosts.... They never scold me&mdash;are
never angry with me, beyond pulling an ugly face now and again&mdash;only
they are so infernally dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw him to the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Paul!&#8221; she said&mdash;and added, laughing: &#8220;Get you a
wife&mdash;and learn to play with children.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shut the door and went back to her task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho! the man has quite forgiven himself for a life full of
meannesses,&#8221; she yawned.</p>

<p>She sat down wearily in her chair by the stove, and as she got out
her proofs to correct for the press, she sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank heaven, the last page!... Heigho! I am weary....&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank back in her chair; and as her eyes closed, her hand upon
the last corrected page, she fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Caroline awoke in the greying dawn, the small Betty was
sitting in a chair near the boy&#8217;s bed, solemnly reading by the guttering
candle. The child had set a kettle to boil; and tea-cups and an old
brown teapot of the kind that is called toby shone invitingly on the
little table whereon the candle feebly struggled against the cold light
of the coming day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Caroline roused, and, walking to the child, she stroked the dainty
little head.</p>

<p>Betty rose, fetched the kettle that purred on the stove, and filled the
teapot; and, when she had let it stand for a spell, she drew off a cup
of tea.</p>

<p>She looked round.</p>

<p>Caroline was kneeling by the bed of the sleeping boy, her head
buried in her arms.</p>

<p>Betty slipped quietly from the room.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Miss Betty Modeyne wins more Hearts</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a month or more before the boy was allowed to go into
the country; so that it was early summer by the time they sent
him away with Netherby&mdash;the small Betty being added to mother
the party at the last moment, there having arisen doubts as to
the quality of the housekeeping owing to the absent-mindedness
of the bear-leader. So for a fortnight there was a happy party
at the old inn by Burford Bridge.</p>

<p>Where the Major slept during the fourteen nights was never
known; but city wags to this day aver that it was beside the
wine-cooler under the sideboard at <i>The Cock and Bull</i> in Fleet
Street. There are discrepancies, but the weight of evidence lies
near the wine-cooler....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fresh air of the Surrey uplands soon had the lad Oliver
strung to the full pitch of devilment that is nature&#8217;s questionable
gift to boyhood; and he rapidly regained what Netherby Gomme,
with meaning accent, called his &#8220;habitual rude health.&#8221;...</p>

<p>Whilst Netherby Gomme filled the morning hours with the
winning of bread in his little room at the inn, Noll and Betty
loitered by the river and watched the shadowy grey trout lying
along the trailing weeds with blunt noses up stream below the
stilly waters of the sluggish flood; or they wandered in the
meadows where the high whispering poplars line the margin of
the babbling rivulet, their gossip leafage never ceasing the
tattling of secrets with the gadding winds amongst the passing
rumours of the high heavens; or they climbed the long green slope
of Box Hill up to the swinging sky a-top, until it seemed that
they might touch the clouds by mere uplifting of outstretched
hands, all England lying like a pleasant garden at their feet; or,
topping the hill, they would clamber down its steep wooded side,
and so out upon the road at foot to the little stone bridge, where
they would lean over the parapet and watch the enamelled
dragon-fly hang quivering above the glassy pond, scintillant in
gay attire with all his silver armour on, bedecked in splendour
of green and purple jewellery; or they would flirt pebbles at the
shy black water-hen that bobbed up to her quaint swimmings;
and so, strolling round by Dorking town, as the sun topped its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ascent and blazed hottest to its first hour of decline, they would
make for their inn, to drag Netherby out of his den for luncheon,
and get them into the breezy dining-room that gave on to the
grassy garden where the butterflies fluttered amongst the roses,
and the lurching flycatchers swooped down upon such of the
gadding beauties as were least bitter to their dainty palates, and
drowsy bees buzzed at their honey-gathering amongst the fragrant
white trumpets of the tobacco-plants, and the fantastic box-trees
that hedged their ken danced in the sunny glare that shimmered
upwards from the panting earth. And all the careless
world was full of balladry.</p>

<p>The mid-day meal done, they would roam out on to the green
lawn and sit in the shade, reading some thrilling adventure, or,
dragging Netherby with them, break the law and invade the
kitchen, where the jolly hostess of the inn would point to the
written word above the chimney-place but scarce enforce the
law, nay, even dust chairs instead to hold them there; and the
cook would pin a kitchen clout to each of their shoulders to display
their shame; so they would sit and gossip of the little world
about them; and the big-hearted busy woman would discover
little stores of hardbake and shortbread and suchlike delightful
evils for young stomachs, for she had a soft heart and was fond
of her joke&mdash;and Netherby came out ridiculously well on such
occasions, and the others were not wholly demure. The gay
banter would go a-tossing.</p>

<p>Or they would wander round to the stables to call upon their
friend Sim Crittenden&mdash;the prize-fighting ostler with the gentle
eyes and the temper that nought might ruffle and a singing voice
like a baritone god&mdash;who, leaning on the long wooden handle of
his pitchfork, his shirt-sleeves rolled up, and his braces hanging
looped against his breeches&#8217; flanks, would stand at the end
of the stables and sing to them songs from Handel and the
masters&mdash;<i>Ruddier than the Cherry</i> and <i>Toreador</i> and <i>Nazareth</i>,
even descending, with apologies, occasionally to <i>It&#8217;s a Great Big
Shame</i> or other latest music-hall lilt.</p>

<p>Netherby, who began to fear a too poetic pastoral atmosphere
at the inn, was to have satisfaction in the life of action that he
adored, and a lively descent to vigorous prose.</p>

<p>The hard-hitting ostler was to strike the dramatic note.</p>

<p>Adventure came with the rougher element that rattled down
in hired carriages to the inn, chi-hiking and using squalid language
along the highroad on their week-end outing from London
city. Cockney youth, with fantastic picturesque tendencies as
to dress, and crude love in the wagonettes, descended to the
ground, alighting before the inn, and swarmed into the drinking-bar,
thirsty with the swallowing of dust and much shouting,
buxom beauty hanging upon their arms with proud gaze boldly
cast upon their noisy lords from under the heavy hair that shaded
their frankly vulgar eyes, and with ear-racking laughings from
their full red lips to greet all their swaggering gentlemen&#8217;s uttermost
ribaldries.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Inflamed by beauty, cockney youth was on the strut, well-inclined
to debauch; and much beer did the rest.</p>

<p>They made the inn a riot of vulgarity.</p>

<p>Yet, all had gone well till twilight, and had as likely enough
gone well to the hour of their home-going&mdash;and they were already
foregathering in the tap-room for the drinking of the last glass&mdash;had
it not been for the garrulous and boastful habit of the gardener
of the inn, a red-bearded fellow of weak knees and splay
feet, who got to bragging about the inn&#8217;s ostler. However, a
cockney youth, a clean-limbed, quick-eyed cub, being grown
something tongue-loosed by reason of the beer, at once brought
out his conceit and paraded it&mdash;it also had to do with some little
parochial honour in which he was held with regard to the skilful
use of his naked hands&mdash;he had made some tough fellow&#8217;s nose
bleed or arrived at the like godlike achievement. He thought
himself a match, he said, for any fellow that messed about horses.
This with prodigious blasphemies. Whereat the red-bearded
gardener laughed loudly; and the cockney youth, fired with
wrath, hit at the centre of the laugh, and missing the gardener&#8217;s
mouth, the which was no such difficult job for the tangled thicket
of red hair about the laugh, got his clumsy knuckles somewhere
in the region of the gardener&#8217;s nose and set the blood flowing.</p>

<p>The barman called for order, and the cockney youth, forgetting
the impiety of mishandling the authority of the chair, got his five
fingers into the potman&#8217;s neck-cloth.</p>

<p>Then it was seen that Sim Crittenden, the ostler, stopping in
the midst of the deep note of <i>Nazareth</i>, walked blithely out of the
stables on light springy feet, passed along the highroad before
the inn, and swung open the outer door of the drinking-bar.</p>

<p>He stood before them that brawled in the tavern and grimly
eyed the riot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who undid the potman&#8217;s necktie?&#8221; he asked in a deep
growl.</p>

<p>The cockney youth turned and put out his chin. He said he
didn&#8217;t give a ruddy geranium who did it, but he was sober enough
to take the whole responsibility of the humours of his particular
wagonette on his own naked shoulders. He personally detested
the potman&#8217;s taste in ties.</p>

<p>The ostler knocked him down.</p>

<p>The cockney youth got up again and lashed out with his hands&mdash;London
breeds courage when it is not cowardice, to the full
pitch; every cockney is a potential hero when he is not a whining
thief&mdash;he was knocked down again.</p>

<p>He scrambled up, and began to feel about dazedly for the
ostler&#8217;s face, but was grown vague as to the object of his hate.</p>

<p>The ostler put down his hands and said that the other might
now walk out into the lane with the honours of war if he so willed
it; and he added that he hoped he would go out like a gentleman,
as he, the ostler, had a deep-seated distaste to making a mess of
the bar with anyone from London. He opened the door for him
with the polish of a courtier.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>The cockney youth honestly thought of a dignified exit, but
beauty nudged at his elbow and whispered a mean design that he
should kick the ostler in the waistcoat.</p>

<p>He made the effort to this base end; was parried; and forthwith
kicked for his iniquity through the door into the road,
receiving a violent blow under the ear as he went.</p>

<p>They all rose up and rushed at the ostler. But they went to
their undoing. There was no refuge in retreat, no backing into
the room from the smite of the great hands, for the red-bearded
gardener assailed from behind&mdash;he had a heavy foot. One by
one they joined him who stood in the dusk on the King&#8217;s highway.
And the road was strewn with their hats.</p>

<p>The ostler came to the doorstep and touched his forelock:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I put in the horses, gentlemen?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>They gathered together in the grey of the twilight muttering
mean vengeance, but the cockney youth who had brought them
to it said commandingly, &#8220;Chuck it!&#8221; which being interpreted
meant that the vulgarities were at an end.</p>

<p>He went up and held out a hand to the ostler:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a better man than me,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;when he hits me
hard enough; and you ain&#8217;t the one I&#8217;d choose to slap my face.
Hold out your olive-branch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ostler held out a great paw and they shook hands; the
ostler&#8217;s grip, said the cockney youth, made his teeth ache.</p>

<p>The gardener strolled about and restored the scattered hats.</p>

<p>The ostler stood in the twilight and smiled.</p>

<p>The sulky fellows put aside evil desire and came and gripped
the great hand that made their knuckles creak.</p>

<p>Then he sang them old-world <i>Ruddier than the Cherry</i> whilst
their women led their cockney loves aside to the dark shadows
under the trees and furtively comforted them.</p>

<p>It all struck the small Betty that it was an indecent sight. Yet
there was a thrill of contentment in her heart that it should have
fallen to the man who could sing <i>Nazareth</i> like a god to do the
blood-letting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the days when it rained, the little party, Betty and Noll
and Netherby, would sit in the small parlour of the inn where
Nelson and his Emma had spent those pitiful hours many years ago,
the night before the great Admiral posted to the sea-coast to hoist
his flag aboard the <i>Victory</i>, being at the beginning of that journey
that ended in his splendid death at the triumph of Trafalgar&mdash;his
frail Emma going from the little room, a broken woman, to
Neglect, and Worse....</p>

<p>So the happy days went by, until the hour struck for departure.
The good hostess kissed Betty on the doorstep, the dainty little
lady being dressed for travel&mdash;and had to go indoors for the tears
that would run, fleeing from the distress of further good-byes.</p>

<p>The glorious sun found them at last, with their pathetically
small packages, at the little railway-station, the prize-fighting
ostler carrying Miss Betty&#8217;s little bag, and hovering about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
party, a drag at the corners of his mouth. He was sadly lacking
as to his wonted tuneful gaiety.</p>

<p>As the train came in he found an empty carriage for them.</p>

<p>Betty, stepping forward, held out a dainty hand.</p>

<p>The ostler took it, and, stooping down, stroked it between his
mighty palms:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look ye here, Miss Betty,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll be a great lady
some day&mdash;I haven&#8217;t been chucked out of a markiss&#8217;s stables
without spottin&#8217; the breed when I see it&mdash;but it may likely enough
take some nasty days getting there.... Now, missee, if you
ever wants anythink in my line of business,&#8221; he added significantly,
&#8220;this address will always find me&mdash;it&#8217;s where my old
mother lives. And if so be that you ever wants physical assistance,
jest you go to the nearest telegraph-office. You&#8217;ve only
got to say the word, and wheresoever it be in the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland or the parts lying adjacent
thereto, Sim Crittenden will spoil the handsomest face the Lord
ever made&mdash;so help me God!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took off his hat and held it in his hand, and they each in
turn shook his great fist.</p>

<p>He blew his nose strenuously as the train moved out of the
station, Betty, where she sat in the window, biting her handkerchief,
the tears streaming down the child&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The prize-fighting ostler sang no song for several days.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which contains Some Hints towards the Making of a Baronet</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">A door</span> opened, and the echoing tramp of feet on the carpetless
boards of the corridor outside ushered the entrance of two men
into a large room, wholly devoid of furnishment&mdash;the plaster of
its walls as bare as its ceiling and floor.</p>

<p>The short, stout, red-faced man shut the door with a slam that
resounded through the empty place, thrust his thumbs in the
armholes of his waistcoat, and said with pride:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir; how do you call that for a stoodio!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the fading daylight the younger man, dandified, self-possessed,
deliberate, dressed in the severest high fashion of the day,
stepped to the end of the great empty place and surveyed it
calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Malahide&mdash;it is the sort of room I should delight to
furnish as I liked&mdash;and then live in it,&#8221; he said; and he sighed:
&#8220;I have the palatial instincts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with a charm of accent and of manner that drew the
frank admiration of the vulgar other; indeed, the stout Mr.
Malahide was looking at a handsome young Englishman in all
the first graceful vigour of early manhood&mdash;for Bartholomew
Doome&#8217;s lithe slender build gave him an easy carriage of the
body that told of well-knit strength, and put aside the hint of
effeminacy suggested by the great beauty of the head. As the
stout man had said to his wife this very morning: &#8220;You could
find it in your heart to stroke him down with yer &#8217;and, like a dam
race-&#8217;orse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Malahide pushed his silk hat back upon his florid head and
looked thereby even more vulgar than his Maker had intended
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;ye like it, eh, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile still flickered about Bartholomew Doome&#8217;s lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask, Mr. Malahide,&#8221; he said drily&mdash;&#8220;what I am doing
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat little man kicked out his legs:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it, sir,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s just it. Well, you see,
it&#8217;s this way. Now, Mr. Doome, I&#8217;m a pretty good-hearted, but
rather damn vulgar man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>He waited patiently for an answer.</p>

<p>Doome looked at him steadily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;by the splendour of God, you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Now, sir, I&#8217;ve made my bit of money in the house-furniture
business already; but Tankerton Wollup he&#8217;s at the
top; and he&#8217;s dead sure to become a bloomin&#8217; baronet; and he&#8217;s
as vulgar as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, eyeing the floor at his feet, meditatively.</p>

<p>Doome nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will only interrupt you to question the accuracy of your
statements, Mr. Malahide,&#8221; he said grimly.</p>

<p>Pompey Malahide laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well, where Tankerton Wollup can climb,
Pompey Malahide can get his boots&mdash;and he&#8217;s going to&mdash;though
Wollup&#8217;s father did have the business shrewdness to christen him
Tankerton&mdash;if you can call it christening in Wardour Street....
Tankerton Wollup! Mine called me Pompey! but, bless him,
the old man&#8217;s only fault was his sentiment. Pompey! Why,
Tankerton&#8217;s a name to conjure with! Who&#8217;d suspect that his
Christian name was Isaac? And if yer had seen the dirty hole in
the city where he began and&mdash;&mdash; But, steady, Pompey, my boy&mdash;we
mustn&#8217;t rake up the manufacture of antique things. Besides,
luck has been with him all through&mdash;he is even a <i>red</i> Jew....
However, sir, you have brought to my shops of late more than one
tip-top swell that bought the real old stuff; and I don&#8217;t mind
tellin&#8217; you that that&#8217;s the side of my business I intend to develop....
Wollup and me began life by debauching public taste&mdash;and
he&#8217;s chucking it&mdash;and it&#8217;s time I did.... I want to meet
my God like a man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was as a baronet,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The dealer laughed loud and long:</p>

<p>&#8220;God! what a wit you have! Now, sir, don&#8217;t you hit me on
the neck.... Well, I&#8217;ve got clear enough eyes to discover that
<i>you</i> know the good stuff when you see it at sales, just by the good
taste that&#8217;s born in you. Now, it&#8217;s no manner o&#8217; use putting that
good stuff in <i>my</i> windows&mdash;the people that furnish their houses
slap through from my shops don&#8217;t know the good stuff when
they see it; and, I&#8217;ll be honest with you, sir, I&#8217;ll be damned if <i>I</i>
do&mdash;and my partner, that did, died last Saturday. You see, sir,
the fact is I&#8217;m in a hole. I know good stuff if it&#8217;s been the
fashion long enough&mdash;but I have not the knowledge to <i>set</i> the
fashion. <i>You</i> have, but you can&#8217;t for want of means; whilst I
want to and have the means. I hope I&#8217;m not talkin&#8217; like a
bleating cad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome watched the fat, downright little dealer
out of languid eyes; but his alert mind followed every hint.
And he had, besides, a very soft corner in his heart for the man.
But he said not a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Doome, I like you&mdash;though they do say you are the
wickedest man in London&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Bartholomew Doome flushed with pleasure&mdash;he was easily
flattered by genuine praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Malahide!&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the fat important little man, &#8220;I like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome bowed. The dealer put out a hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you sneer, Mr. Doome. A man can&#8217;t give more than
he&#8217;s got&mdash;and liking&#8217;s the biggest thing he&#8217;s got&mdash;to bestow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will know when I sneer, Mr. Malahide&mdash;I do not feel like
it yet,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; well, I&#8217;m glad of that, sir.... Because&mdash;I&#8217;m going
to ask you if you&#8217;ll accept an offer. You can but refuse it, when
all&#8217;s said&mdash;and break my heart.... I wouldn&#8217;t dare to make
it, but I&#8217;m a shrewd business man, and I&#8217;ve hunted up one or two
young fellows I&#8217;ve seen about with you, and asked them how you
lived&mdash;and it has emboldened me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Mr. Malahide. I will ask you no names, but&mdash;may
I ask how my friends solved the problem?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat dealer laughed embarrassedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;They said they were damned if they knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;that sounds like my friends.... And the
fact is I scarcely know myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dealer nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir; what I propose is this: I am not fool enough to
think you will turn shopman&mdash;it would ruffle you to death&mdash;and
you&#8217;d make a poor one when you did it&mdash;your university career
has spoilt you for success in business. But if you&#8217;ll drop in
casually when I ring you up&mdash;there&#8217;s a telephone in the next
room&mdash;and give me an opinion whenever I want it; and if you&#8217;ll
let me furnish this room as your studio with anything you like,
just for an advertisement for me amongst your swell friends and
the newspapers&mdash;if you&#8217;ll give me the benefit of your good taste
and advice on my better-class furnishing business&mdash;I only ask for
your mornings&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you a thousand pound a year for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He peered anxiously at the smart young fellow before him, and
added hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t say No. There&#8217;s my hand on it&mdash;or
you can take time to think it out if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out a fat jolly vulgar hand.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome grasped the hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t mind telling you, Mr.
Malahide, I&#8217;ll be glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; bawled the fat little dealer, his red face perspiring
with glee as he walked briskly up and down rubbing his hands
in his relief. &#8220;By Rupert, I&#8217;m born to luck. Got <i>that</i> beastly
job over.... Well, sir, the day after to-morrow you are free
of all my shops, or anywhere you like to pick things up; and just
you order what you wish for this room&mdash;there&#8217;s a couple of rather
nice little rooms off it, and a jolly little hall&mdash;do it all regardless
of cost. And&mdash;oh yes&mdash;&mdash; Now look here, Mr. Doome, to-day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
cast the die. I&#8217;m straight off to give orders to compete for a
big hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came close to Doome and whispered as though he feared the
very walls might hear. Doome listened closely.</p>

<p>The fat little man stood back a pace:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Pretty strenuous idea, that!... Ye see, Wollup
he did the one just opposite.... Now, I don&#8217;t mind even
dropping a bit of money over it. Can you go over Wollup&#8217;s
upholstery debauch to-morrow morning, then meet me opposite
after lunch, and just give me tips to lick Wollup off his bunyanny
feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the beaming Pompey. &#8220;My manager will be
at my elbow making notes. Don&#8217;t take no notice of him. Just
you plan the hotel like a lady&#8217;s boodywar, in good colour and
telling style&mdash;the sort o&#8217; thing that pleases the eye so you want
to kiss it. Make it <i>sing</i>&mdash;like a ruddy violin. It&#8217;s got to put
me in front of Tankerton Wollup. See? Just come in, sir, as
if you had a mortgage on the place&mdash;don&#8217;t mind me&mdash;and&mdash;well,
it&#8217;ll be a bit of All-Right-O! See?... Oh,&#8221; he added, growing
suddenly serious&mdash;&#8220;look here, Mr. Doome&mdash;you see&mdash;my
boy&#8217;s at Harrow, so he&#8217;s all safe from me, bless the lad; but&mdash;my
girls are springing up&mdash;rising sixteen one of &#8217;em&mdash;and&mdash;they are
fine stylish girls, too&mdash;but&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I have my qualms that
I rub them on the raw a bit. Now, you might give me a hint&mdash;now
and again&mdash;if I&mdash;well&mdash;<i>you</i> know! Just say: Malahide,
my boy, you&#8217;re on the vulgar side, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Off side, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be a baronet yet,&#8221; said he.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with the Fascination of Naughtiness</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Doome&#8217;s</span> studio became the talk of the town.</p>

<p>Who, that is Who, has not sat therein?</p>

<p>It came to be a part of the great Social Function to have the
entrance to this handsome room.</p>

<p>The rich tapestries that hung the walls, the glowing colour and
the beauty of the furnishments were held in restraint by the
chastening, somewhat religious, atmosphere that made the
whisper of wickedness add such a mysterious charm to his habitation
as it did to the attraction of the dark-souled mysterious
Doome himself. No one knew a single vice against the slender
handsome youth of the pale classic features and the black hair
and immaculate dress; but it was said that things were said.
And he was too charmingly delightful&mdash;and just a little alarming.
Thus gossip wagged an artful tongue.</p>

<p>Dingy-looking weak-eyed journalists of the inferior press
sneered in unsigned paragraphs of rancid English at his effeminacy,
hinting at unmentionable sins&mdash;who, had he struck them,
would have thought a horse had kicked them&mdash;he, whose only
agony was that they should belittle him with their praise. Rude
sporting men, that passed their virile lives gazing at horses galloping,
said he wanted kicking. None kicked him.</p>

<p>Perhaps the great church candlesticks that rose in massive
wrought brass from the dark stained floor at the ends and by the
sides of the large room, holding aloft enormous candles half way
to the high ceiling, struck the religious note. Or it may have
been the exquisitely rich image of the Mary which stood on the
mantel amongst the glowing splendid nudes. But the yawning
accents of the most garrulous society babbler sank to a whisper
on entrance. Nay, the most brilliant rakes had been known to
lower their strutting voices on coming into this room. The
faculty of reverence lies dormant in the cynic as in the fool.</p>

<p>Nobody had been known to see Doome at work. It was said
that some beautiful women could have said things, and they
would. But they would not. Yet his exquisite craftsmanship,
the wondrous musical rhythm of his line and the quaint and
rather morbid fancy of the subjects that came from his pen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
together with a certain uncanniness of imagination, continued
to pour forth masterpieces in black and white, startling the
world of art and delighting the lovers of his genius.</p>

<p>It was significantly whispered that he never worked except at
dead of night, with the great candles lit, and all the old-world
glass lustres that hung from the ceiling aglow with a hundred
lights; it was then, said the traffickers in scandal, he came out
to the practice of his art in a silken dressing-gown&mdash;the most
beautiful woman of London sitting to him to snatch a little of
immortality.</p>

<p>The scandal grew.</p>

<p>Society wrangled for him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Lord of Furnishments&#8221; (writes Bartholomew Doome about
this time, the summer being at wane, to Mr. Pompey Malahide)&mdash;&#8220;the
air of this city of London is stifling me; the very sins of the
town are grown banal, commonplace. I must to Paris. I leave no
address for three months; but a telegram to the Hotel Albe will
be seen within three days. The town is grown an empty caldron&mdash;you
yourself had best get away with your lovely daughters to
some gayer city of fresh air and to change of cheerful small vices
and reflecting shop-windows.... But you will go, whether I
advise or not. Meanwhile I am letting the studio to the Honourable
Ponsonby Ffolliott, only son and heir to Lord Wyntwarde
of Cavil, until the twenty-seventh of September. It will take
three full days to rid it of the multifarious scents upon him, and
to lay the echoes of his yaw.... Can I procure you fal-lals of
price for Miss Mary, or adornments to mar the beauty of Miss
Judith? Tush! I speak cant. It is all nonsense about painting
the rose. Why do beautiful women wear clothes if so? And
what a noise would be in Fleet Street, if the roses came out wholly
without adornment! Fancy thyself, Lord of Furnishments, blushing
like peony, taking thy Johnsonian walks abroad, unbedecked
and unadorned&mdash;not, as now, almost wholly hidden! Thou
wouldst be fantastically wonderful indeed, who art never wholly
devoid of fantasy. The ladies might come out better; but
naughtiness would the more shamefully abound. Personally,
I am not against the rose; but the gods have ordered the painting.
So be it paint.</p>

<p>I think you have galled the emotions of the egregious rival.
I passed Tankerton Wollup on the Embankment meditating on
the sea-gulls and the factories beyond, alone with nature who was
never given to contemplate the works of nature. It is full time
you joined the Primrose League, captured a seat in the Commons,
and rubbed elbows with the nobility&mdash;when Tankerton Wollup
has headache by reason of your greatness. I see, too, in visions,
Miss Judith with a coronet a-top her pretty brows. But mark the
law&mdash;rub elbows only with the old nobility&mdash;the new aristocracy
is so very exclusive. Have an eye to subtleties; and thy translation
is sure.</p>

<p>But should the gods burst the casket of their very uttermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
honours at your feet, and fill your broad lap with treasure, you
will never be greater than you are.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">Yours, mightily beholden,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Bartholomew Doome</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The sting is ever in the tail. Nature herself hath so
ordered it. I ought to tell you that this Ponsonby Ffolliott
thinks he can paint. Gods of little Egypt, it is all very dreadful&mdash;makes
the teeth ache&mdash;but he is well satisfied. What more
can heaven send? But the point of the tail is this: ... He
took to the arts, <i>patronized</i> them, but six weeks ago. He had
drawn &#8216;funny pictures&#8217; as somewhat ignoble school-boy at
Harrow, it is true; but it was the study of the nude model that
finished the business&mdash;&#8217;twas beauty unadorned, lacking even as
to fig-leaf, attracted our recruit. He fell into someone&#8217;s studio,
a model sitting at the time, and the great idea was bred&mdash;within
the winking of an eyelid&mdash;leaped, hissing hot, from the intellectual
furnace.</p>

<p>There is already a more than ugly story going about that has
to do with this blood ass of Balaam coupled with that pretty little
ethereal woman who sat for me a while ago. I suppose one must
believe women capable of any enormity in these days. And
these youths sin such dirty mean sins&mdash;even sin has lost the
grand manner.</p>

<p>And the tools of his craft! Such an ordering of the Latest
Thing! I was present&mdash;a silent witness. My poor easel for the
making of the mere black-and-white art is well put away in
hiding, or had cracked of envy in such splendid company. No
expense spared.</p>

<p>Yet he has his patiences. Rubs out more than he puts in.
Is indeed a master of much bread-crumbs. He has the catch-words,
too&mdash;is for Art for Art&#8217;s sake, contemns Story, shrugs at
the Anecdote, sneers at the Soul, purrs of Values, insists that the
Picture shall Keep Within the Frame, rattles all the jargons, and
shows a fine contempt for Sargent and all the modern men&mdash;yet
has almost decided that Whistler <i>may</i> live&mdash;holds, however, that
great Art died with the Renaissance; is not quite sure what the
Renaissance was&mdash;or where&mdash;or when. He chats as glibly as the
rest now&mdash;hee-haws against the hee-haws of Quogge Myre&mdash;and
not always in vain. Indeed there are degrees in asininity, when
splendour of hee-hawing out-brays the lesser hee-haw. And,
Beelzebub! such knees as are on him!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Which tells of a Poet that offered Himself for Sacrifice, and was
Rejected of the Gods</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last day of September has early bridal with the night.
Though the afternoon was not full spent, the dark shadows of
the coming darkness held the town. In the midst of the gloom
that was in Doome&#8217;s studio stood the sulky figure of the Honourable
Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott; and, at his feet, there crouched
on the floor a very young and very beautiful woman, and her
head was bowed. Wringing her clasped hands upon her knees
she said hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;God have mercy upon me&mdash;for this is an awful caricature of
His image.... I am lost&mdash;lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fidgeted peevishly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, my dear girl, this is most annoying,&#8221; said he, with
self-pitying drawl&mdash;&#8220;your taunts are in such bad taste&mdash;and it is
so absolutely embarrassing. And&mdash;I so positively detest being
embarrassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet wearily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ponsonby, all my things are packed, ready to go&mdash;Heaven
knows there was not so much to pack&mdash;it is not that. I do not
want to encumber you&mdash;to embarrass you. I am going. This
place is not such a bewitching Paradise, nor its memories so sweet,
that I should stay. I know your time at these rooms is up. But
you&mdash;even you&mdash;must surely realize that I cannot go home where
a harsh and bitterly religious step-father sits at the table.&#8221; She
drooped her head: &#8220;I could not disguise my state for a day.
And they are so religious.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fidgeted her fingers pathetically:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she moaned&mdash;&#8220;I cannot go home&mdash;there&#8217;s no smallest
mercy in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Honourable Ponsonby broke into her mood:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I say, my dear gal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>How she had grown to hate the dreadful drawl!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ponsonby&#8221;&mdash;she grasped his arm feverishly, trying to rouse
some honour in him&mdash;&#8220;I have no money&mdash;none. I shall soon
be a mother. You have made it impossible for me to make
money in the studios. At home,&#8221; she laughed sadly, &#8220;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
think I am studying art.&#8221; She got a-brooding. &#8220;The child
will require care.... Where, in God&#8217;s name, am I to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;er&mdash;I don&#8217;t really know. You see I&#8217;m so bad at
arranging things.... Almost an ass in some things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched his sleeve&mdash;so pathetically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the child be born in honour&mdash;a secret marriage&mdash;anything.&#8221;
She shrank back. &#8220;It is dreadful to think of being
tied to you,&#8221; she moaned, &#8220;but&mdash;for the child&#8217;s sake&mdash;for the
child&#8217;s sake you must be made to remember your promises&mdash;you
<i>must</i> give the child honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw his inane mouth opening to the uttering of foolishness.</p>

<p>She dropped at his feet, bowing her head to her shame, a
wounded broken woman&mdash;this little more than child&mdash;soon to
be the mother of a child.</p>

<p>He fidgeted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, my dear girl&mdash;it can&#8217;t be marriage,&#8221; he drawled,
&#8220;because I&#8217;m&mdash;er&mdash;morally married already&mdash;I&#8217;m almost engaged&mdash;and
you know&mdash;as a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She brushed her hand back over her forehead. The enormity
of his idiotcy stung her, and she groaned:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;what a bleating fool this is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, call me ridiculous names,&#8221; he complained huffily&mdash;&#8220;but
I&#8217;m really glad to see that you realize that&mdash;er&mdash;as a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the floor, and turned upon him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why, in the name of all&#8217;s that abominable, did you do
this thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He licked his lips sullenly, flinching a little before her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you see&mdash;I knew you would see reason, that you
would see that it can&#8217;t possibly be marriage. And as to providing
for you, don&#8217;t you see I have so precious little for myself&mdash;and
I have such awfully expensive tastes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; she growled, stepping to him, with a sudden urging
to strike him&mdash;&#8220;I could kill you.&#8221; And she added hoarsely: &#8220;I
almost think I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be violent&mdash;I never know what to do when a
woman is violent. In my family the women are never violent....
You see, Polly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t befoul my name by speaking it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;My <i>dear</i> girl, this melodramatic way of life is most repulsive
to me&mdash;it makes me feel quite nervous and ill,&#8221; he added plaintively.
&#8220;You used to be such a nice girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into laughter, miserable laughter, and wrung her
hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, this is awful!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She fell a-brooding.</p>

<p>The long silence made the youth uneasy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Polly, don&#8217;t you see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Urgh!&#8221; She swung round upon him savagely&mdash;growling as
a leopard might: &#8220;Stop that awful bleating. Your voice turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
my blood acid&mdash;is like some filthy stench to me.... If you
value your life, keep that dreadful voice still.... Let me
think. In God&#8217;s name, let me think.... What to do? <i>that&#8217;s</i>
the bewildering thing. You, who make me stand a-wonder how
I suffered myself to let you touch me&mdash;you, with your dreadful
idiot&#8217;s stare and slack mouth (Mother of God, I too must be a
living idiot!)&mdash;you have robbed me for months to come even of
benefiting by the basest traffic in which a woman may barter
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of a sudden she turned to the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; she said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;go away&mdash;or I shall do you an
injury. Quick! I can descend to no more foul shame than I
have now known. Go&mdash;and, as you love yourself, I say, don&#8217;t
let me hear that awful bleat again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked out of the room in his weak-kneed way, huffily, and
was gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She stood listening there, until all echo of him, dandified, weak-kneed,
had passed out of her ears.</p>

<p>And when the world was become wholly silent, the tense mood
passed. She sank to the seat of the sofa and bent her brows on
the problem, what to do? Before her was blackness. No
writing across the sullen sky.</p>

<p>As she sat thus in the gloom, scowling at cruelty, a key turned
in the lock outside, there was the loud slam of the outer door, a
heavy step or so, and a man&#8217;s figure entered into the dusk of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eustace Lovegood!&#8221; she said hoarsely. &#8220;The good God
must have sent you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man started; took off his hat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul, Miss Whiffels, <i>you</i> here! Mr. Doome has
asked me to use his rooms&mdash;for a month.... But I did not
know there was anyone&mdash;I mean, he&mdash;must have forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;I have no business here&mdash;none. Eustace,
I am a desperate woman. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;where&mdash;to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I show a modesty that I once had&mdash;a long while
ago&mdash;quite some months now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Eustace. I must state the indecent thing to somebody.
This man has debauched me&mdash;body and soul&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! Bartholomew Doome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. This Ffolliott person&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ffolliott?&#8221; His surprise was unmitigated.</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that is the worst part of my shame. It bleats in my
ears just like that.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen. He will not keep his bond&mdash;I cannot appeal to any
sense of honour. He himself does not know how to spell the
word.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8220;What! you are not married to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No. My degradation has not sunk to that. He has not even
the will nor the desire to support me even for a little while&mdash;until
the child is born.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man frowned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do not think he is quite such an unmitigated cad as
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the sofa wearily and went to the fireplace:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like some smallest proof,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;for This is
the father of&mdash;my&mdash;child.... Give me some smallest proof,
Eustace, that this man has a shred of manhood&mdash;the least little
frayed shred. I have made every appeal&mdash;appeals for enslavement
which, if granted, would have bitten into me like the teeth
of a dog. But, for the child&#8217;s sake, I held out my hand to be
bitten, bared my breast, begged him to befoul me with his
benefits!&#8221;</p>

<p>She uttered a little harsh laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was saved the dog&#8217;s teeth of that ignominy,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Lovegood had stood, pondering hard; he suddenly remembered
a five-pound note which had been paid to him that day.</p>

<p>He coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as it happens, he has given me rather an embarrassing
task to fulfil,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He sends you some money by me&mdash;I
wish my friends would not always give me their unpleasant duties
to perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man tugged the crisp banknote out of his breast-pocket,
and brought it to her.</p>

<p>She took it; and crumpled it in her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will touch nothing,&#8221; she began passionately, swinging her
hand to fling the money into the fire&mdash;stopped&mdash;turned sharply
and looked keenly at Lovegood:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Eustace&mdash;it&#8217;s clean after all! What a sweet big-hearted
liar you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>She went up to him, pulled down his great head, and kissed him
on the cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;you make me sane.... But you
are a wretched poor hand at any deceit.... A poorer evil-doer
surely was never born.... But, as a matter of fact, the very
heavens are against you this time&mdash;the bleating awful Thing has
only just left the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, God forgive me, I saw him. He smelt of Poudre d&#8217;Amour
to the Haymarket.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led her to the sofa, sat down beside her, and took her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us pollute the air with him any more,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;let
us talk about pleasant things&mdash;like <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was becoming quieted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;I must try and keep myself from horrors&mdash;for
the sake of the little one.... Eustace, I believe you have
something of the woman in your big heart&mdash;and, thank God, you
have come to me&mdash;for this man has made it impossible for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
talk to women.... So I have had to buy a book. It told me
all about the influences upon the unborn child.... I must get
the memory of this man out of my mind&mdash;cleanse my ears of him.
You must come and see me and keep me from thinking&mdash;the
blood that ought to be leaping for delight of this little one was
being turned to poison&mdash;and, now, since big awkward you came
into this twilight, I am almost glad the little one is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man, elbow on knee, leaned his chin on his knuckles
and looked at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Polly,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I see a better way out. Suppose you
let me father the child! You might do worse. I am a lonely
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such good in store for me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She took his face between her two slender hands and kissed him&mdash;on
the brows and cheek and lips and chin:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how it is that no woman has loved you, Eustace....
It will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>He could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>She sighed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;One day you will know why I say No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You will
know that I loved you too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I think I know now.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which hints at an Age of Gold</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Increasing</span> good fortune came with sundry little successes; and
gradually the pressure of want was eased, and the attic became a
place of comfort and small luxuries.</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere realized that for the boy the ordinary
public school life was not only beyond her means, but that it
would now be a sheer waste of time. She therefore, foreseeing
that thereby as many good mid-day meals would be assured to
the big man under witness of her own eyes, and the small fee helpful
to him besides, induced Eustace Lovegood to furbish his
mathematics and give the boy a couple of hours of them four or
five mornings of the week; and Betty, taking the big man&#8217;s hand
at the conference, shyly slid into the arrangement.</p>

<p>Lovegood&#8217;s affection for the boy and girl gave him complete
command of their attention; and his large scrupulousness, wide
humanity, and great-heartedness had an even mightier educational
force upon them both than the clear wits he brought to
bear in luring them along the gritty path of the dry philosophy
of numbers. In his hands geography and geology became a
romance&mdash;an education in themselves; and science a glittering
enchantment. He directed their reading in literature and
history and government and statesmanship and social laws, which
he put before all else for the training of the good citizen. Indeed
he had only to guide&mdash;for they were greedy readers. He laid the
classics at their feet, making them read good translations first,
giving them a clear idea of the author&#8217;s relation to the times in
which he wrote, and persuading the youngsters, after the mathematics
were done in the morning, to run through some pages of
the Latin or the Greek with him &#8220;to keep up the tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s wits awoke at once, roused as they had never been
roused, to an eager curiosity about the very things that at school
had but irked him and been an unmitigated weariness to him. He
now found that the thing to be expressed was the important
thing, whereas formerly, in the schoolroom, ranged in a row of
some score of indifferent yawning others, he had been whipped
into regarding the way of saying it as of the only interest&mdash;nay,
the sole interest of the schoolmaster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>To his profound astonishment, he found that these old books
<i>meant</i> something&mdash;that they were not exquisite torture-racks,
appointed by some vague, hated, and arbitrary governance over
them, for the mere racking of their wits in the cracking of the nuts
of grammar&mdash;that it was what these old fellows had seen and
known and felt and thought that was worth the thinking and the
puzzling out, and <i>not</i> the machinery of their thought.</p>

<p>So that what had aforetime gone in at one ear and out at the
other now lodged in the brain and painted pictures in the imagination
that none might rub out.</p>

<p>The boy had groaned over his Xenophon, until &#8220;Thence he
advanced parasangs and stathmoi&#8221; had become the refrain of
boredom as repulsive as the epileptic drivel of Revelation. He
now discovered that the book contained one of the mighty adventures
of the world. He stepped it out with Xenophon and the
Ten Thousand in Cyrus&#8217;s march, listened to the camp scandals of
the years ago, thrilled by the perplexities and endurance and
dangers and hair&#8217;s-breadth escapes of the questionable undertaking;
followed the great and dogged retreat; took a part in the
passing incidents, hunting the bustards, tiring them down, and
finding &#8220;the flesh of these birds very delicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dawdled before Troy with the Homeric heroes, fought with
them, listened to their gossip, bathed with them, sacrificed with
them.</p>

<p>The Latin tongue revealed other emotions than the frenzy of
doubt as to whether Caius and Balbus should build unending walls.</p>

<p>To him, Roman Horace, growing fat, unwieldy, laughing at his
own disadvantages in subtle Latin verse, lolling about M√¶cenas&#8217;
villa, became a live acquaintance, as real as the people he rubbed
against in the street.</p>

<p>And every day the number of his acquaintance grew.</p>

<p>As real, more definite than the swarm of boys with whom he
had played at school, became Charlemagne and Clovis and Capet,
Simon de Montfort, and Bastard William of Normandy and the
First and Third Edwards of England, and Cromwell and Chatham
and the men of the French Revolution. The very hours of the
day, seasons of the year, became frequented with the association
of the great dead, so that in the after-years of his manhood, at
the break of day it almost seemed that there stole across the
years, back over the edge of the drowsy world, out of old pilastered
Greece, the hushed image of that festival drawing to its end when
Socrates rises from the symposium, the last of his mighty boon
companions, drawing his garments about him as he passes out
from them that he has outstayed, where they lay adrowse and
overcome with wine on couch and floor&mdash;in such strange fashion
giving to the decaying genius of Greece the new ideals that were
to prepare the civilized world for the coming of its Christ&mdash;a
strange uncouth figure in a wondrous mist of dawn.</p>

<p>The twilight became haunted with the drowsy music of Grey&#8217;s
<i>Elegy</i>, sounding to some mystic fugue played with Handelian
dignity upon the aerial organ of the winds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>The history of the mightiest people the world has seen leaped
into life again, seen through the gossip eyes of them that had
watched its pageant pass, its comedy and its tragedy&mdash;Pepys
and Boswell, and the splendid gossips of their day&mdash;or in the
mighty music of Carlyle&#8217;s colossal and glowing imagination, of
Oldmixon, of Macaulay and of Green.</p>

<p>In fact, the big gentle man taught the boy and girl the great
aim of education&mdash;to know; to educate themselves; to have
self-reliance; to establish a code of conduct; in a word, to form
character. For, he pointed out to them, the good of the community
is the highest human aim, and knowledge of this world
the only basis on which to build conduct towards that end.</p>

<p>And, the morning&#8217;s work done, he would counsel exercise,
taking them himself sometimes to Booksellers&#8217; Row, walking
beside them, with the great black cloak and theatrical strut,
striking a little out of their way towards Soho, before they
swung round into the Strand, to drag out Netherby to their
frolics; and the four of them, making down their beloved Strand,
would haunt the Row by hours, poring over the stalls of the
second-hand booksellers, garnering their rare pennies to thrilling
purchases in the glorious dingy dusty narrow old picturesque
alley of splendid treasure.</p>

<p>Indeed, Netherby Gomme did not lack bodily exercise in these
days, for the boy and girl considered no junket complete without
him. So Noll and Betty and he would go for walks to Chiswick,
down the river to Hampton Court, stroll the Strand and gaze
into the print-shops that lay thereabout, loiter on Westminster
Bridge and wander in the Abbey; haunt the picture-galleries
and live in the pits of theatres, getting passes at times from the
kindly bohemians to dress circles&mdash;and sometimes Julia would
come, her long day&#8217;s work being done.</p>

<p>And there was surely no better audience than they. They had
the true theatric instinct&mdash;the right theatre spirit. They were
in their seats as soon as the opened doors would let them enter.
The tuning of the fiddles was exquisite music to their ears&mdash;an
essential part of the drama. Every moment was precious to
them. They would as lief have missed the rising of the great
curtain, sweeping upwards with ecstatic jerk into the flies, as have
gone out before the last act, or worn their hats to spoil the delight
of others. For them the Theatre held something of a sacred
pleasure&mdash;the dear pleasaunce of populous cities.</p>

<p>Ah, the golden age! the days of the wide unquestioning
delight in all things that is the eternal theatre of the childhood
of the world&mdash;for, thank God, Fancy fills the very gutters of the
street-children with faery. There is a world of delight enwrapped
about a rag doll&mdash;when the world is young.</p>

<p>They were glad to be alive.</p>

<p>And as they took their pleasures, so they took their serious
moods, taking the best from all that came. They would dawdle
into the churches, leaving early when the parson was dry&mdash;Protestant
and Papist, High and Low. Particularly the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Catholic, drawn by the √¶sthetic beauty of the Service, and
charmed by its exquisite symbolism&mdash;for they were children
when all is said, questioning nothing that was established,
accepting everything, believing in belief. And the lank awkward
Netherby Gomme perhaps the simplest-hearted child of
the three.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alas! that there should loom ever at the end of all things the
threat of change! And that the young feet, with restless skip,
should go so eagerly to meet it!</p>

<p>The three went down to Burford Bridge one day&mdash;there having
been much careful garnering of sixpences to that end.</p>

<p>They burst into the old inn&mdash;to be rebuffed.</p>

<p>The jolly old landlady was gone&mdash;their friend the ostler wholly
vanished&mdash;no trace of him.</p>

<p>There was hint of sellings-up, and broken fortunes, and sad
flitting from the old home.</p>

<p>Strange faces smiled these things down upon them indifferently,
indulgently.</p>

<p>No, with headshakings, there were no prize-fighting ostlers
that sang like baritone gods, no heroes nor colourable imitation
of heroes in the stables&mdash;none. Nor indeed anything more
romantic than racing touts&mdash;lazy rogues that sold the hay and
corn when the watchful eye was not upon them....</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with the Awakening of Youth</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boy and girl sprang up apace; their brains developing added
perception and quickness under Lovegood&#8217;s tuition&mdash;wits are
whetted by congenial wit.</p>

<p>The stripling&#8217;s voice broke, lost its treble, and for awhile was
awkward to the ear, as his lank limbs to the eye; and a-top of the
change the down came upon his lip, adding the last touch of
whimsy to youth&#8217;s ungainliness. Betty came through the awkward
age less awkwardly, showing a lithe gracefulness in her very
lankness of limb.</p>

<p>The girl it was who began to show shy reservations.</p>

<p>The lad was becoming restless with&mdash;he knew not what.
Coming adolescence was setting his youngster blood a-jigging.
Boyhood was gone&mdash;youth not fully come. Romance was singing
in his ears&mdash;adventure thrumming impatient fingers on the
windows of his fancy&mdash;hot instincts leading his feet&mdash;wilfulness
challenging his daring.</p>

<p>In all this dangerous period of his cubhood, the girl&#8217;s sweet
companionship steadied the lad&mdash;kept him from many tomfool
waywardnesses. Her fragrant hair, loose-flowing to the winds,
brushed his cheek and veiled him in from much unwholesomeness.
The girl&#8217;s slender gloved hands held the key to his nobility&mdash;opened
to him only the view of the best that was in him; whilst
his protection of her, and his frank confidence in her, filled the
lad&#8217;s body with early manhood that had otherwise been filled
with indecision and with many and uncouth vulgarities.</p>

<p>And just as, his voice breaking, a hoarser accent came into his
speech, so, too, a more robust accent came into his thinking. He
began to question, first of all here and there, then from roof to
base, what he had accepted with a boy&#8217;s frank acceptance.</p>

<p>The Why and the Whence and the Whither had begun to
trouble.</p>

<p>He and Betty had taken to going to church of a Sunday evening.
At last, puzzled by many things, the lad went boldly and
called on the vicar. Encouraged by the well-bred courtesy of
the gentle-hearted man and by the noble simplicity and selflessness
of his life, and full of eager questionings, he had gone again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a time or so; but he found his blunt queries evaded&mdash;the deep
inmost and basic meaning of life and death, when he pressed for
an answer, was at once thrust behind a screen of God and angels,
seen dimly across a gulf of heavens and hells, in the human form
and habit, and with those earthly functions of which the disembodied
spirit had no further need, and through a veil of vague talk
of the inspired word.</p>

<p>The inspired word!</p>

<p>Inspiration that could allow discrepancies in the simplest
details of the most important things&mdash;one gospel giving the
Annunciation to Mary, another to Joseph&mdash;one giving the
Anointing by a woman to the beginning of the ministry, the
others to the eve of the Crucifixion&mdash;all differing in the statement
of the great and solemn act of the very Crucifixion&mdash;one
stating that the Christ bore His cross, the others that Simon bore
it&mdash;disagreeing even as to the bitter drink that was given and
when given&mdash;disagreeing as to the hour of the great tragedy&mdash;every
one of them all contradicting each other as to the sayings
on the cross&mdash;the statement by Christ in one gospel to the repentant
thief that they would that day be in Paradise denying that
the Christ really descended into Hell and rose again the third day&mdash;one
gospel contradicting the others as to the acts and sayings
of these thieves&mdash;all at variance even about the last dying words&mdash;all
writing different inscriptions over the suffering head&mdash;one stating
that the body was embalmed, another denying its embalming.</p>

<p>There were larger discrepancies: How could the devil tempt
God? And even so, what virtue were in so easy a triumph?
Why had God, out of His creation of all things, created the devil?
How could He punish for sin who had created sin? Why did
God create a world so faultily that He Himself condemned it?
Why punish His own bungling upon His miserable creatures?
How could He set up as eternal reward the prospect of the good
being with Him in the heavens and listening to the agony of the
victims of His poor maimed handiwork in hell? What had man
done more loathsome than to create a Hell? Was this gruesome
heaven of gloating over the agony of the damned to be our Immortality?
If these things had been written to-day instead of
coming out of the dim glamour of the centuries, would they be
believed?</p>

<p>The vicar was genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>He stammered of Conduct&mdash;he did not guess the extent of the
boy&#8217;s reading.</p>

<p>The good man had always looked upon any who questioned
Christianity as atheists and agnostics&mdash;upon atheists and agnostics
as criminal and brutish persons. He had never realized that
some of the noblest, greatest, purest and sweetest lives had been
lived by these&mdash;nor that some of the foulest, most damnable,
and criminal lives had been spent in vileness by princes of the
Church.</p>

<p>The boy bent his brows on the old gentleman&#8217;s embarrassment....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Already bored by the vicar&#8217;s dusty sermons, and now baffled
to find that what had baffled him likewise baffled the vicar, he
turned his back on the Church of his people and went with Betty
to the pro-cathedral of Rome.</p>

<p>The beauty of the service, its music and its splendid symbolism,
appealed for awhile to his artistic senses; but the questionings
soon began again to unsettle the lad. For he found that he
could not get to the root of things in this exquisite place even as
far as with his old vicar. He had imagined the Roman Church
as united&mdash;as agreed. He found it racked from one end to the
other by the warring pronouncements of the Fathers. The cardinal
himself it was who blew up the bridge that spanned the
road to Rome.</p>

<p>It was the day of a great mass at the Oratory. It had been
noised abroad that the church was to be draped red with handsome
draperies&mdash;that the cardinal was to speak, robed in his
crimson vestments. All the leaders of society that held to the
Papist tradition were to be there&mdash;and, as events turned out,
there was, besides, a large gathering of Society that owned no
allegiance to Rome, yet enjoyed a handsome pageant.</p>

<p>The boy and girl went&mdash;anxious to hear what message the illustrious
prince of the Church had for their hearts&mdash;what guidance
for their lives&mdash;what he had to say upon the great intellectual
advancement of the age&mdash;what upon the great questions that
loomed before the puzzled brain of man.</p>

<p>And he, the appointed spokesman of the infallible church,
smooth-faced, aristocratic, magnificent, arose from his seat at
his ordered place in the elaborate service, and his voice broke the
musical refrain of the splendid ceremonial with disturbing accent
but to reiterate the narrow message of his Church that only
through absolute subjection of mind and body to the forms and
traditions and quaint superstitions of that Church could man
be saved from everlasting damnation; and, with triumphant
note, he revelled in the fact, and could get to little else, that the
English Church, which had persecuted Rome for generations, had
now begun to place her images upon its altars and in the emptied
niches of its portals&mdash;had indeed filched the rubric and the habits
and the symbols of his Church! And, with exultant voice,
swelling to arrogance, he, with the same lips that called his
Church catholic, whilst in the very act of narrowing it to a
parochial destiny, twitted with parochialism the land whose large
religious toleration allowed his Church to live unmolested where
that same Church had made a shamble and a stews when it was
in power, debauching its once opportunity by fire and torture,
showing in such strange hellish wise its large Catholicism to such
as had differed from its narrow creed. He spoke passionately
of past persecution&mdash;he omitted to say who had taught the
lesson.</p>

<p>But of the Why and the How and the Whence and the Whither&mdash;nothing.
All the flattest Agnosticism....</p>

<p>That evening the striplings, together with Netherby Gomme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wandered, with a crowd that pressed, into the large and simple
place of worship of a well-known chapel to hear a great Protestant
preacher. This man, unaided by the gorgeous ritual of the
morning that appealed to every artistic sense, made the simple
Protestant claim to individual responsibility, to acts of life as
against the ritual of churches. He ignored all Christolatry, as
a grown man sets aside the toys of childhood, and his voice
thundered that the life of the individual would be judged solely
by the part it played towards the ennobling of the community.
And he showed that just as Christianity had been born from the
Jews and the Greeks, so had Protestantism in turn been born out
of Rome; and so must the future ideals of the great peoples,
purified still more and more by rejecting the false and the superstitious,
be born again out of this same Protestantism.</p>

<p>It was the large, daring, and frank mind of this man that
roused the lad from the lethargic irresponsibility of his boyhood
to his duty towards life. Just as the Romanist communion by
its ideal of the salvation of the individual through and by the
community has weakened the force of the individual, so the
innate difference of the Protestant ideal, the salvation of the
community by and through the individual, strengthened the lad&#8217;s
nerve and made his will resolute. He flung off his reliance on
others and faced his life and his destiny.</p>

<p>He roused from the drowsy contemplation and the fantastic
dreads of otherworldliness&mdash;ridiculous heavens and more ridiculous
hells&mdash;and turned to life. For awhile he was not troubled.</p>

<p>The genial optimism of youth came back to him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was soon after this stage of awakening intellectual unrest
that the lad found himself embarked on the larger tide of the
literary and intellectual unrest of the Continent.</p>

<p>Mixing more and more amongst the Bohemians, he found himself
amongst frank and fearless thinking; he was roused by the
inquisitive genius of France&mdash;heard the first words of the daring
speculations of German thought. He realized that religious
teaching had passed from the Church to the newspaper&mdash;to
literature&mdash;and to the arts; that religion, from being a fierce
war of priests, was become a searching into the everyday life of
the community, was become a fierce desire to better that life.
The angels were flown, theology gone to dust, and man was
seeking after the godhead that is in him&mdash;he who had kissed the
feet of idols, cringing for salvation in whimsical heavens, now
stood up and looked at the meaning of manhood.</p>

<p>Thou Shalt Not was giving place to Thou Shalt.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Coming of Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre upon the
Town</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre</span> had caught the ear
of the town with the brazen strains of the New Literary Movement.
Fresh from France, he had written a novel, Englished in
the French idiom, and founded on the closely detailed, elaborately
seen, unselected picture of life as it straggles by, that is
called Realism&mdash;that movement which, combined with splendid
courage, had lifted Zola to the front rank in contemporary
French literature. Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre
had all the faults without the genius of the Frenchman; and, by
consequence of these things, Mr. Myre had tasted the sweets of
his first success of scandal. People had said that his book was
indecent&mdash;and read it.</p>

<p>Mr. Myre had then struck one of his master-strokes, and
straightway set himself up as lawgiver and head and front of
Taste by criticising everybody and everything. And with a
quick receptive mind for the catchpennies, the slang, and the
cant of the studios and of the students&#8217; quarter, of the stage and
of the literary schools, he had picked up the details of every movement
in the restless air of Paris; and he now proceeded to exploit
them in London. That one thing flatly contradicted another gave
him no embarrassment&mdash;he was there to harass and embarrass.
Conventional critics went down before the cocksureness which
was the flashy weapon of this, to them, most original man. The
erratic amongst the journalists, they that live on the jigging foot,
quick to see the vogue of this catchpenny-monger, were soon
hard at it, too, seeking to gather in whilst the harvest was for
the gathering, rushing to nature, or what their cockney senses
told them was nature, so that when they conjured up the vision
of the ploughman in the fields one perceived the sourness of his
sweat rather than the fragrance of the earth or the mystic significance
that is in the ploughing.</p>

<p>But Myre founded his eminence on no single dunghill. He
set his building on a more certain base&mdash;he thrust down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
splay feet firm into popular Romance, and he saw to it that
the whole whispering world should not miss it. He was living
with one of the greatest French actresses of the day&mdash;and from
Marguerite Olm√© it must be set down in credit to his judgment
he was catching a reflected glory that was far greater than his
own.</p>

<p>Given boon companions, Myre was wont to make no secret of
the fact, nay, rather a pretty confidence of it, that he was exploiting
a great passion&mdash;&#8220;taking up a great woman&#8217;s soul by
the roots to examine it,&#8221; was the florid paraphrase.</p>

<p>Art, said he, demanded every sacrifice.</p>

<p>That his extravagances were largely paid out of her bread-winnings
he did not parade&mdash;as smacking perhaps of the too
sordid. Realism has its limits. All nature is not to be crammed
into an ink-pot nor three hundred pages.</p>

<p>Marguerite Olm√© had come to play in England for three weeks.
The French critics had set down her genius as the greatest of the
age. In England, few people understanding her, this verdict had
been enthusiastically repeated; and after a triumphant procession
through the United States, where she was understood still
less, it was written down that she was even greater than that.
And indeed she was little less.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre increased
in violence and in volume, magnified by the reflected light; and
his conceit grew ecstatic.</p>

<p>He made his enemies. They called him Quogge Myre, for
short, or The Brixton Celt. There was some spite in it.</p>

<p>This at first fretted him somewhat. He had always been distressed
that his name was only of one syllable&mdash;Shakespeare,
Homer, Dante, Milton, Chaucer, Balzac were of two.</p>

<p>Still, there was Poe!</p>

<p>He tried his own name on his tongue. He wondered if it could
ever sound like the name of a man of genius.</p>

<p>Then there came to him a sudden glow&mdash;it was more
original.</p>

<p>He felt that the time was come to gather in disciples; he chose
a foreign restaurant, in the French quarter where, he darkly
hinted in the press, and to all and sundry, that the wits might be
seen of an evening, glittering resplendent. It was at this time
that he gave forth the now famous essay in which he showed
once for all how the home life checked the range of genius; in
which he proved how the wifely <i>milieu</i> stunted the view and narrowed
the eagle flight of the original intellect; that same essay
in which he showed that a woman should be well content to be
simply beautiful, relying on man&#8217;s chivalry for her sufficient
empire; in which he also proved beyond shadow of doubt that
it was due to the meeting of the wits in the tavern and the
resulting whetting of the national genius that the French
achievement so far transcended the English&mdash;indeed, he
pointed the moral in a florid picture of Shakespeare glittering at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the Sign of the Mermaid&mdash;he even invented some lines for
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The tavern club was like to be born again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme, seeing the inquisitive mind of the lad Noll
beginning to run upon the literary warfare of the day, set Noll&#8217;s
heart jigging one evening by calling for him, together with the
airy Fluffy Reubens, and taking him out into the London night
to spend an hour or two at the great man&#8217;s tavern.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Strutting Cock comes near to Losing a Feather upon his
Own Dunghill</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a table, with his disciples, sat Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin
Myre&mdash;a slack-headed, loose-lipped, colourless-haired, untidy-minded
fellow enough to outward seeming.</p>

<p>As Noll listened to his affected voice and caught the tenor of
his mind he understood why the man was known amongst the
robuster wits as The Brixton Celt.</p>

<p>Sitting next to him, and admiring himself in a mirror opposite,
was his friend the poet Aubrey, who, it must be acknowledged,
paid but little attention to anyone but himself. As Noll entered
the place Myre&#8217;s loud drawl was giving utterance to the innuendo
that the love of woman was only worth the seeking in order &#8220;to
take her soul up by the roots and examine it&#8221;; on which Aubrey
had raised a laugh somewhat at his own cost and yet with a certain
vague undefined loss to the Quogge Myre, by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I personally am content to take up my own soul by the roots
and examine it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the ironic applause and laughter were run down, Aubrey,
still gazing at himself, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That laugh is sheer affected hypocrisy. I am of the only
importance&mdash;that is the only real heart&#8217;s creed of man.&#8221; And
he added lovingly: &#8220;I thank God that I am beautiful&mdash;very
beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a historic night....</p>

<p>Quogge Myre had been irked of late by the perpetual reference
to him as the English Zola. He felt that he ought to be original.
He saw that he must again strike a new and original note. Above
all he felt that Realism was running dry&mdash;the public were grown
used to it; nay, worse, the public had accepted it at his estimate.</p>

<p>On this evening he had planned the surprise of a great Renunciation.
One or two sonnets had been given by poets, as was the
custom in Parisian students&#8217; taverns, before Myre himself arose to
read an essay he had just written, and thus give to the privileged
few the advantage of the earliest communion with his latest
thought.</p>

<p>He astounded them that were gathered about him by attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Zola and Realism with bitterness; and he solemnly announced
his decision to break with the movement for ever.</p>

<p>All these little men stared aghast&mdash;they had only just acquired
the style and method and some little vogue upon their capture
of the tricks of this very Realism. And for a few moments they
were dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Had they not &#8220;written each other up&#8221; on their mastery of
this very craft!</p>

<p>Even they, like Myre, had discovered that the superficial tricks
were easily captured.</p>

<p>But, as Myre read, they began to glow, as though in some
measure sharing in his greatness&mdash;he put that hint to them with
subtlety.</p>

<p>It was that famous essay in which he showed, once for all, with
aggressive air as though the prophet of the gospel, that Realism
was a Failure&mdash;that all Art must be symbolical. Though he still
maintained that the expression of it must be of the hammered
and perfect metal called Style, he had overstated the case for
style&mdash;but he did not withdraw everything. He had said that
Style was the All in All&mdash;that the matter did not matter. He
renounced that position. Style was important, but it was the
symbols that were significant in art.... Then this man, who
baldly stated how he had thrust himself upon Zola, proceeded
to tell how he had tricked Zola into giving him the advertisement
of his praise, how he had lied to him, how he now despised him,
because Zola, being grown rich, wrote in a room that was a bourgeois
ideal of handsome furnishing. He employed all his sarcasm
on making ridiculous what only the genial hospitality of the
kindly Frenchman could have thrown open to his treacherous
censure; and he ended with a scalding attack on the coarseness
of Zola&#8217;s work and on the lack of its artistry. For himself&mdash;he
had discovered a greater master, whose name was Ibsen. &#8220;In
so far as my work has unwittingly been symbolical,&#8221; said he, with
the majesty of a great renunciation, &#8220;in so far has it been good.
For the rest, it has been written in vain....&#8221; To achieve the
masterpiece, he was content to go to the Greeks&mdash;to √Üschylus, to
Euripides, to Aristophanes, to Sophocles in drama, to Homer in
the Epic, to Phidias in art&mdash;the Greeks, he averred, recorded only
the Inevitable Thing.</p>

<p>As the great man sat down amidst a thunder of applause, Noll
leaned over to a pimpled disciple:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;what has this man done?&#8221;</p>

<p>The youth gazed at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that he has done anything yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That
will come. He has the right attitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pimply young man blew out cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme rose to his feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to ask our Master,&#8221; said he, without trace of
smile on his cadaverous face, &#8220;and I ask it because I have only
read Sophocles in the translation&mdash;to which of the plays of
Sophocles did he allude when he burst into his splendid eulogy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the Greek genius just now&mdash;<i>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus</i>, or <i>Ajax</i> or
<i>Hecuba</i>, or was he thinking of the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre licked his puffy red lips
uncomfortably, but said nothing. He smiled cynically to cover
his hesitation&mdash;the fact was that he had never read a play by
Sophocles, even in translation. There was a long tense pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sophocles had the right attitude in <i>all</i> his plays,&#8221; he said at
last&mdash;&#8220;what is true of one is true of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby sat down, and laughed loud and long:</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a game-cock!&#8221; cried he&mdash;&#8220;if a game-cock could
sing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll touched his sleeve confidentially:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Netherby,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Sophocles did not write <i>Prometheus
Bound</i>. It was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Noll&mdash;the ass hasn&#8217;t the smallest idea of that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Myre was uneasy, feeling he had not been wholly secure, when
all eyes turned upon the entry into the caf√© of a very beautiful
young woman.</p>

<p>She walked to a small table and sat down.</p>

<p>Myre at once became hysterical; and proceeded to embarrass
the girl with his vulgar eyes.</p>

<p>She ordered some coffee of the waiter, and, fretted by the
admiring stare of these gentlemen, soon rose from the table,
shortened her skirts above her dainty ankles, and went out
into the night.</p>

<p>Myre, offended by the girl&#8217;s ignoring, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The amateur is sapping the arts of all strength. The county
gentry are destroying painting and the drama. That woman is
an exquisite stick on the stage&mdash;she is connected with a peer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by marriage, I suppose,&#8221; said a handsome youth flippantly;
and rising from his chair with Byronic gloom, he put on
his silk hat&mdash;&#8220;I must follow her; she is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the pimply young man leaned over to Noll,
and said with hushed admiration:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bartholomew Doome&mdash;the wickedest man in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Noll&mdash;&#8220;what does he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has never been known to give way to a decent emotion,&#8221;
said the youth....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Myre bought a translation of the plays of
Sophocles, and armed himself against his disciples. A cold sweat
broke out upon him as he paid the price and realized how near he
had come to losing his wits on his own particular dunghill.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Master Devlin throws a Fierce Sidelight upon
the Genius of Poetry</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Literature</span> might be born and die, and pass wholly away; but
the wordy warfare of the distracted parties to each quarrel roused
no such serious questioning in the most perfervid contestant&#8217;s
thinking parts as was now troubling our Noll&mdash;the down was on
his lip and chin and cheek; and the getting rid of it had mastered
his ingenuity. He was balked. The flame of a match had sent
the fluff to the ceiling in √¶thereal dust more than once; but now
the increasing stiffness threatened bristles. He must be driven
to the razor or to untidiness&mdash;and the eyes of young women forbad
the untidiness. In his difficulty he put the point to Netherby
Gomme; and Gomme, grimly suppressing the smile that lurked
behind his serious eyes, led off the lad forthwith to his barber.
It was thus that Noll first came to frequent the place where the
wits lost whatsoever strength of hair lay in them.</p>

<p>Mike Devlin was lord and leading man of action in the rooms&mdash;and
it is doubtful if he were not the leading wit&mdash;if we may
judge by the relics of it that still do duty amongst the youth of
the parish. He had two white-coated assistants in his clipping;
they made the laughter to his airinesses also, when chins were
slow in the wagging, coyly and splutteringly as they dared.</p>

<p>A cling of the shop&#8217;s bell.</p>

<p>The little cockney Irishman roused at sight of Netherby
Gomme, and, at the word, he soon had Noll swathed in cloths
and bibs and towels, and was lathering the soapsud on his face.</p>

<p>Devlin opened a long friendship with the youth by subtlety,
shaving deftly the while over somewhat smooth ground:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in literatoor, sorr, I&#8217;ll be thinkin&#8217;?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted the youth; and added dryly: &#8220;More
or less.&#8221;</p>

<p>He winked to Gomme, feeling the joke was with him&mdash;and the
alert Devlin, catching the wink, saw that the boy was at ease.
The first shave, Devlin was wont to say, was as distressing to one&#8217;s
egoism as the marriage service to a maiden&#8217;s modesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be po&#8217;try, will it, sorr?&#8221; asked Devlin.</p>

<p>Noll shook his head:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Mike Devlin smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;s not aisy to put poets under Mike Devlin&#8217;s
hands without me knowing the feel of them. I can just smell
them. Be Joshua, I shaved one every mornin&#8217;, when it wasn&#8217;t
afternoon, for eight months on this very floor, and I got used to
the feel of them.... Ah, that was a great poet, mind ye. Eh?
I&#8217;ve clean forgot his name, but he was a great hairy man wid a
head on him like a dam besom&mdash;ye could have swept Fleet Street
wid him.... When that man walked down the street the
whole town looked at him and said That&#8217;s a blarsted poet!...
Begod, yes, that was a great poet. When he&#8217;d got the frenzy on
him he hadn&#8217;t the time to clean himself. Eh, sir? What did he
write? Why, just po&#8217;try. His shoulders was stooped with the
application of him&mdash;begod, the very trousers on him betrayed
the genius in him; they had knees on them like a horse that&#8217;s
endin&#8217; his days in the cab traffic. Oh, yes; ye could see the
great man just fretted the pantaloons off himself wid worryin&#8217;
at the rhymes.... Po&#8217;try&#8217;s an oneasy means of livelihood,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.... And, in fact, I had a slap at it meself....
I tried to pull off one of these pastorals, they call it, wid the cattle
goin&#8217; down to the drink and the great dirty blacksmith leanin&#8217; on
the anvil, takin&#8217; a spit at his hands and makin&#8217; the sparks fly,
and the blacksmith&#8217;s daughter wid the beauty of old Trotter&#8217;s
yellow-haired barmaid on her; but the divil a rhyme could I get
to the blacksmith&#8217;s daughter but &#8220;fills her leathern sides wid
water.&#8221; Well, in comes the poet one morning and asks me if
I&#8217;ve made me will; but I told him my paleness was due to the
po&#8217;try, and that it made life too oneasy and I was going to shake
it off me heels. What&#8217;s the matter wid po&#8217;try? says he. Wid
that I discovered me tribulation to him, and he mighty nearly
got the whooping-cough&mdash;he told me I had better put aside the
seductions of the Muse, I was sufferin&#8217; from the echoes of old
refrains. But it didn&#8217;t cost me a night&#8217;s sleep, thank God. Ye
know, after all, sir, po&#8217;try&#8217;s like the hair-cuttin&#8217;&mdash;ye&#8217;ve got to
be born to it, or ye&#8217;ve got to lave it severely alone.... Eh,
sir? Ah, yes&mdash;be the gospels, he was a great poet&mdash;ye could
smell the midnight oil on him. He just lived at the desk, gettin&#8217;
the rhymes into collusion. Genius? he was full of it. Free love
was nothin&#8217; to that man. Aisy, sorr, or I&#8217;ll be cuttin&#8217; the nose
off of ye! But as he said to me himself, there&#8217;s one law for
genius, Devlin, and there&#8217;s another law for the middle classes;
and it&#8217;s bad morals of the middle classes to try and usurp the
weaknesses of their betters, says he. By the book, yes; he had
the hall-mark of genius on him&mdash;he had the divil&#8217;s own contempt
for the middle classes. They were like orange-peel under the
great heels of the man.... Po&#8217;try&#8217;s a pagan callin&#8217;, says he,
when all&#8217;s said&mdash;and if ye&#8217;re goin&#8217; to make po&#8217;try ye&#8217;ve got to
live it like a pagan, says he. And, by jewry, he did. Pagan he
was&mdash;as Pompey&#8217;s pillar. Eh, sorr? Can&#8217;t I remimber anny-thing
he wrote?... God knows. They tell me it was mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
poems; but I keep to the accidents and the police reports, wid a
dash of the politics, in the newspapers&mdash;the damned rhymes and
superfluities always take my attention from the meanin&#8217; of the
sense&mdash;I&#8217;m that nervous all the time that the fellow will get his
rhyme nately fixed up in the next line, by the popes I always
forgit what the tune&#8217;s about.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood off, and, head on one side, looked at the youth&#8217;s clean-shaven
face with the air of an artist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind ye, sorr,&#8221; said he, damping the soap off his face&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
not blamin&#8217; the poets. That&#8217;s a queer onnatural life they lead.
Mr. Myre, that was in here just now, was complainin&#8217; to another
genius of the damn hard life of it he had, what wid the sinfulness of
his natural nature, and his emotions, and the doing of things that
wasn&#8217;t expected of him, and all the celebrated women after him&mdash;but
now, <i>there&#8217;s</i> a man that stands to his principles like a hairy
Afghan to his fowlin&#8217;-piece&mdash;he was sayin&#8217; that an artist must
have <i>lived</i>&mdash;and it is a part of his sacrifice to himself that he
should debauch himself for the good of posterity, otherwise he
only guesses at life like the maiden aunt lookin&#8217; furtively over
the window blind at the drama of the street. Begod, it&#8217;s the
keen satirical tongue he has, Mr. Myre, when he&#8217;s pullin&#8217; the
leg of the maiden aunt.... <i>And</i> the self-respect av him!&#8221;...</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which discovers a Great Man in the Hour of his Triumph</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre</span> stood at the
windows of the best rooms of the best hotel in London&mdash;he enjoyed
the fine view, the great reach of the Thames&mdash;the towers
and ancient majestic piles and many-windowed warehouses
turning to fairy palaces in the lilac haze of the coming twilight.</p>

<p>The great actress&#8217;s infatuation for him brought him his every
desire in these days; and he felt that such was as it should be&mdash;it
was pathetic to think of the number of common-minded persons
who must have lived in that room and seen no beauty in the world.
Nay, it was a crime. He sighed that Nature was so wasteful.</p>

<p>He stood, his hands behind his back, his colourless hair with
its untidy forelock over his paste-coloured forehead, a smirk
under his drooping, ill-kempt moustache. His sloping shoulders
shrugged content:</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;this is my day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Myre was thrilled at a far more emotional prospect
than any view of a Thames reach. For days the newspapers had
been quarrelling over him&mdash;his name was everywhere. Worry,
worry, worry! and in the midst of the din was always Quilliam
O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre.</p>

<p>He had struck a master-stroke....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quogge Myre had become weary of his scandal. The novelty
of his relation to Marguerite Olm√© was flown. He was not even
barred. People treated it as carelessly as though it had been
marriage. Nay, worse; society was grown tired of it&mdash;he was
not asked out so much as he had been.</p>

<p>He could see nothing more to be got out of the romantic association;
he had had a splendid flash of life with her, the glamour
that still remained was but the after-glow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And the stage notoriously aged women!</p>

<p>He was no weakling to dawdle on in the twilight of a romance,
kicking his feet aimlessly through the fallen leaves of a withered
passion.</p>

<p>He saw that he must do something original&mdash;or with an original
air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>He had conceived a bold scheme for a renewal of public interest
in him and his works.</p>

<p>He had given to the world a recklessly daring account of his
most intimate relations with the great actress, thinly disguised
as a romance&mdash;indeed, he had forestalled all misunderstanding,
had drawn aside all shred of disguise, by inspiring preliminary
paragraphs in the press.</p>

<p>The result went beyond his wildest hopes; raised him beyond
his fondest conceit.</p>

<p>The clamour was prodigious; indeed, it did the English press
credit, for it displayed a lurking sense of decency, a hint of manhood
in the shabbiest.</p>

<p>The abuse brought this man to the front again; and the curiosity
of smart society was again assured towards him.</p>

<p>And it would do more&mdash;it would make a dramatic end to his
life with the great actress. He had revealed all the secrets of her
dressing-table, the little makeshifts of figure, the use of additions
to Nature&#8217;s artistic handicraft.</p>

<p>It had only been fair to himself; for she had begun to be
tedious&mdash;a bore&mdash;humiliation. To sit opposite to the same
woman at table day after day! It cramped his imagination.
There were two or three other women&mdash;it might make a difference
if he were not tied to this one&mdash;he had only made one mistake&mdash;he
ought to have cleared off the whole of his debts before
he published the book&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His man came in.</p>

<p>Yes, he would dress for dinner. But he had accepted two
invitations for that night&mdash;to which of these handsome women
must he send the telegram of his inability to go?</p>

<p>He decided to dine with the countess.</p>

<p>Quogge Myre adored the &#8220;intelligent&#8221; peerage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her rooms in Paris sat Marguerite Olm√©, reading a book.</p>

<p>She had been reading it all day&mdash;and the red blood burned her
face with shame. She missed no word of the brutal details of her
most intimate life with this man&mdash;there was little reservation,
even by innuendo.</p>

<p>The elbow-nudgings and the leer at her love-ecstasies&mdash;nay, at
the very manner in which she had hidden the only small defect
of her figure; the display of all her bodily habits; the jibes at
the little reliances on the arts of her dressing-table; the sneers
at the coming little threat of wrinkles, at the grey threads of hairs
amongst the glorious nut-brown masses&mdash;tshah! She had been
a mad fool to love a man twelve years her junior! Poor fool,
she blamed <i>herself</i>!</p>

<p>It was one of those books that are written by such men as
batten, parasitic, louse-like, upon a woman.</p>

<p>And this one not only battened upon her means, but upon her
reputation, her honour, her affections, her very soul.</p>

<p>Merely to be rich is to live in the most vulgar state of poverty.</p>

<p>There have been colossal sneaks in the world of letters, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
have not been without genius&mdash;Rousseau, de Musset, and the rest&mdash;though
their genius has been somewhat rotten at the core. We
read every line of Rousseau with suspicion, for is there not haunting
every line he wrote, threading in and out through all, the
ignominy of the dirty little caddish soul that slimes the pages of
his <i>Confessions</i>? And what man does not feel his sex outraged
by the hermaphroditic venom of de Musset as he sullies the frail
love of George Sand?</p>

<p>To betray the woman whose sole folly has been that she loved
you! Even though but for a gadding while.</p>

<p>A woman can give a man nothing greater than the love of her
life&mdash;that is the weightiest dower. It is beyond a price. The
sentences that can only be whispered&mdash;the sentences that cannot
be whispered&mdash;the tendernesses&mdash;the surrenders&mdash;the endearments&mdash;the
mystic emotions that reach in the love of man and
woman the nearest to some ecstatic conception of the mystery
of life, that are the worthy beginnings of a new life, these things
can only be lived; they cannot be spoken of even by the most
reverent tongue; but when their exposure is made the foul
weapon with which to wound the woman for her only fault in
having surrendered herself to an egregious cad, that cad is only
fit to be spat upon. The betrayal of the Christ was to this a
healthy sin. Such a dirty rogue should be blotted out. The wit
of such a man must stink&mdash;if he have wit. The art of such a
man must be a foul sore. The influence of such a man must be
a filthy disease; his companionship a loathsome suppuration; his
life a paltry ignominy.</p>

<p>Marguerite Olm√© brushed back her hair from her brow with the
wondrous hands that were as eloquent as her voice. She was
stunned with shame.</p>

<p>She uttered a little moan, when she should have answered a
light knock at the door.</p>

<p>Her maid entered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame&mdash;it is time to dress for the play&mdash;it is the first night
of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Ernestine!&#8221; she said hoarsely; and the girl was
startled at the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame is ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl ran to her as to a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The wounded woman stroked the girl&#8217;s shoulders, and signed
to a desk; the maid brought her pen and ink and paper.</p>

<p>After she had written awhile, the great actress handed the maid
a book and a letter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ernestine&mdash;this is like a play, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She smiled: &#8220;Burn
that,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;and post this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre was released from
his bondage quite easily. He was cast off.</p>

<p>He read the letter, shrugged his shoulders, flung the scented
notepaper into the fire. He had promised to read her letter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his admirers&mdash;when it came. He decided that he must invent
one instead. Yet&mdash;this one&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was simple enough&mdash;quite devoid of style:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Myre would do well to avoid Madame Olm√©&#8217;s house in
the future, as the footmen have orders to flog him down the
stairs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Myre smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;The French are so melodramatic!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein we are obliged to Spend a Brief Moment in the Company
of the Titled Aristocracy</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anthony Baddlesmere</span> stood brooding in the middle of his
room, his hands behind his back, and his wits hammering in his
skull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh&mdash;sh!&#8221;</p>

<p>He wondered how it was that he had not seen this tangle until
now.</p>

<p>The boy was gone; into his place had stepped a youth&mdash;Noll
was on the verge of manhood. And the lad had the firm mouth
and the strong jaw of the Baddlesmeres.</p>

<p>It had all flashed upon him suddenly; thus:</p>

<p>As he came up the steps to enter the house, the door had
opened and there had stepped thereout a very beautiful girl of
near sixteen, her skirts not quite as long as they might have
been; and beside the girl had walked a handsome youth&mdash;his
son Noll.</p>

<p>Ought this thing to be?</p>

<p>This girl&#8217;s father, Modeyne, was a gentleman&mdash;as a matter of
fact of as good blood as himself, if they came to the arbitrament
of the Heralds&#8217; Office. But he was utterly unclassed! The
fellow was become an Outsider. He was only to be seen in the
city, and&mdash;pah! with such a rank gang of vulgarians! men
whose loud clothes were always aggressively well-brushed, whose
hats, worn rakishly to a side, were aggressively shiny, whose
glittering boots were always aggressively new and suggestive of
the aggressively expensive, whose aitches were the only articles
of subtlety and rarity that they paraded, whose manners were
overbearing and authoritative. God! Modeyne, even when
drunk, shone, for all his falling away, the only man of breeding
in the company.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;he was the falling star.</p>

<p>The girl had not a chance. So Anthony argued&mdash;with what is
called the world&#8217;s wisdom&mdash;and proceeded to take the most
elaborate precautions that she should not have a chance.</p>

<p>Noll&#8217;s calf-love for the girl must be killed. By Venus! she
was uncommon handsome&mdash;there was that excuse for the lad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>But how?</p>

<p>At any rate, there was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>This boy Noll was come within two lives of the Cavil property&mdash;there
was only one between his mother and the peerage.</p>

<p>He thought it would be a mistake to say anything to Caroline
about it. She might go into opposition.</p>

<p>He would make the journey to Cavil and see the old lord at
once. It would mean the eating of much pride; it would choke
him; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stay. An alienated relative makes but a treacherous ally.
Yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lord Wyntwarde strode up and down the great library at Cavil,
where he transacted his business, and all such other like unpleasantnesses,
amongst the books he never read, his hands in
his breeches pockets; and he laughed harshly. He was just in
from riding; and his pink hunting-coat, his breeches and long
boots were splashed with mud.</p>

<p>Anthony, standing in a window, grimly watched him prowling.</p>

<p>The old lord threw back his head as he tramped the floor:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; he bawled, &#8220;friend Anthony! I spoke like the
damned minor prophets, after all, hey!... So you come to
me!... By the dogs, I said it. But you are three years
before my prophecy.... You play the cat and banjo with
my dates. You make me too previous.&#8221; He turned, clinking
his spurs as he trod his heels into the thick carpets. &#8220;I saw the
cub&#8217;s birth in the papers ... seventeen years and a while
ago. But, the cast-iron joke of it! that <i>you</i> should come to
prevent a marriage with an undesirable. Hoho&mdash;ho!... I
swore it&mdash;I swore it should be so.... Gods! how the world
goes round! Round and round and round. And no one grows
a peppercorn the wiser.... Not a damn peppercorn. Tshah!
<i>I</i> did it. But then I foresaw that all the Wattleses would pour
their vast wealth into our coffers&mdash;they love to have a lord in
the family down by Birmingham. Nevertheless, <i>I</i> married a
vicar&#8217;s daughter against my father&#8217;s will&mdash;and she brought forth
Ponsonby!... Gods! have you seen the Thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony said not a word.</p>

<p>The old lord took to his pacing again:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the dogs, an abortion. He cannot stay on a horse long
enough for it to kill him. A horse! Dogs, he hasn&#8217;t even the
blood of the Wattleses in him&mdash;he&#8217;d turn giddy on an office-stool
unless he were strapped to it. He is the very pick of dancing-masters&mdash;he
has cast back to the bank-manager, except that he
can&#8217;t count. There he stands against God&#8217;s heaven, a knock-kneed
reproach to his Maker.... The nearest thing he gets
to a horse is to wear riding-breeches and long boots on the parades
of fashionable watering-places. But he has thrown out a virtue
we none others have had&mdash;he has not gone into opposition to the
head of his house. He will be the twenty-sixth in the title, and
the other twenty-four have pulled their fathers&#8217; beards. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
promised never to marry without my approval....&#8221; He
tramped silently for awhile, and burst out again: &#8220;And so you
think I will refuse to have a word to say to your cub! Well,
you are mistaken. But it is on conditions&mdash;you understand&mdash;on
conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must know the conditions,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must? Hoho! still the organizer of victory, eh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony said nothing.</p>

<p>He stood and watched the striding figure before him, and bit
his teeth on all repartee. He had a dogged desire to win that
which he had come to ask; and he was not going to lose it for the
sake of a score in grooms&#8217; badinage.</p>

<p>He left the waggeries to the noble lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, friend Anthony&mdash;your uncle sold the estates, and
rotted in Boulogne. And the county dropped him&mdash;he only had
the portraits with him when he died. Well! does the world
remember that <i>you</i> come of the Plantagenets? does the county
remember that your sires were William of Normandy and Charlemagne
and Louis Debonair? Not a whit. It thinks you are
a damned scribbling fellow; and, by the dogs, you are. And
the lordship of the manor is gone to some cheesemonger from
down South&mdash;and, hoho! I swear it, your arms are on his carriage
panels, the great damned peacock&#8217;s tail for crest, and the
scarlet torteaux and the blessed chevron. All taken over with
the lordship of the manor. Yes, by the three scarlet tortoises,
their women are wonderful! brand new popinjays on a brand
new stick. Nothing old and dingy in the old home, I can promise
you&mdash;Chippendale and the eighteenth century all thrust
out o&#8217; doors, gone to the workmen&#8217;s cottages&mdash;and the rooms
heavy with full-bellied comfortable saddle-bag lounges and the
Latest Thing. But&mdash;mine host is in Burke, and glitters in
Debrett. And you? Beelzebub! you scribble. You are gone
down to the bottom of an ink-pot. And the boy! our good
Oliver&mdash;where will <i>he</i> go? Yet, by my soul, you did one clean
thing&mdash;you called him after me&mdash;you had sufficient pride to put
aside your dirty conceit and give him the name of the house.
Wherefore, since he is an Oliver, and since he has gone into opposition
to his father, who went into opposition to me&mdash;and since
two negatives make an affirmative&mdash;therefore and whereby and
notwithstanding, I&#8217;ll help the boy; but I say it shall be on
conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony&#8217;s one dread was lest he should discover that Caroline
was not in the surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the conditions?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you begin hectoring me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bloodshot eyes turned glaring upon the silent figure of
Anthony that stood sullenly in the window.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is very little of Hector left in me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had
hoped to have made a decent competency for the boy&mdash;but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have failed.... Perhaps I ought to say that it was not on my
own account that I came here. I remember another and very
serious reason&mdash;one that I thought would appeal to you&mdash;and&mdash;I
think it is the real reason at bottom for your sudden burst of
generosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clinking of the spurs and the striding up and down the
room began again:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not forgotten that there is only Ponsonby between
master Oliver&#8217;s mother and me. I have not forgotten why
you married his mother, Master Anthony.... That was why
I prophesied.... Prophecy?&#8221; He snorted: &#8220;Prophecy be
hanged! It was a jabbering of dead certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony&#8217;s face flushed hotly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing I will not allow&mdash;though the boy rot for it&mdash;the
lie of omission,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who lies?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tramping ceased.</p>

<p>Anthony looked him steadily in the eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have forgotten something, Lord Wyntwarde. There
was a time when you were not so pat with a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have forgotten nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have forgotten to add that you had four children alive&mdash;and
a brother. We scribbling folk call that the lie of omission;
we consider it the lowest of falsehoods. We even hold it a dishonour
to utter it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bloodshot eyes ceased their glare; and the striding began
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Still the damned authority on all the moralities,&#8221; said my
lord.</p>

<p>As a fact, he was pleased at the show of fire. He had begun
to think this man had lost courage; and he would have trampled
him under foot for it. Your braggart only understands courage
when it is announced by trumpet. As it was, he remembered
the ugly threat of a whip that he had once been under from this
fellow. It came to him that he had played the bully to the
limits.</p>

<p>He went to the bell and rang it; and got to pacing the room
again, brooding, until a footman opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Fassett I wish to see him,&#8221; said his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;my lud.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silent chaplain entered the room almost before the servant
was gone, and, glancing at his striding lord and his guest, he
obeyed the sign to sit down at the desk, noiselessly took his way
to it, and placed himself thereat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fassett,&#8221; said Wyntwarde, prowling the while&mdash;&#8220;I want
notes made upon these points: My kinsman, Oliver Baddlesmere,
a young fellow about to go up to Oxford, is to go to Magdalen.
The day he writes to me for supplies from Magdalen he
is to receive three hundred pounds&mdash;and he is to receive it each
year he goes up. Any bills in reason for hunters, or in relation
to hunting, I will pay&mdash;and all wine that shows a gentleman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
judgment. Hatch, my wine-merchant, shall give him open
credit&mdash;and be judge between us. I expect him to live at the
university for his intellectual pleasure and in the society of
gentlemen; not like a damned curate or a schoolmaster. And the
day he enters Parliament or the Guards or some other club where
gentlemen live decent unlaborious lives, his income will be
doubled, and, if need be, trebled. Otherwise he may go to the
devil&mdash;I forget how a parson puts it, Fassett&mdash;and whistle down
his nose for sixpences, or draw little pictures for the illustrated
papers, or whatever else that is the low way these sort of people
grub up a livelihood in the arts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the bell and rang it; and turning to Anthony he
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a lot of handsome women with dull husbands
staying in the house, friend Anthony.&#8221; He laughed roughly:
&#8220;But I suppose it&#8217;s no use asking you to stay for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the footman who appeared at the door; and,
before Anthony could answer, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman must catch the next train to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand with a curt &#8220;Good-day&#8221;; and tramped
out of the room on clanking heels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anthony decided, thinking it out in the train, to tell Caroline
of what had passed, and of the need for getting Noll coached at
once for the next term at Oxford.</p>

<p>He did not see any particular reason why the lad should go to
the university; but everyone did go&mdash;it was the thing to do.
And then&mdash;there was the girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He thought, all things considered, there was no need to mention
Betty Modeyne.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Major fights a Brilliant Rearguard Action; and Beats
off a Pressing Attack</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the hour of social calls.</p>

<p>The suburban world was a-rustle in its best clothes, sallying
forth in carriage and on foot to play at being in the whirl of
fashion; Major Modeyne stood in drunken dignity on the whitewashed
steps of the house, his coat turned outside in, his shirt
hanging out before and behind, and flouted by street-boys. And
the whole stucco front blushed with shame.</p>

<p>Even the titter in the areas, where kitchen-maids peeped
through the railings at the rare comedy, was not without some
sense of adverse criticism.</p>

<p>His &#8220;friends&#8221; in the city had thought the joke a killingly funny
one; indeed, when, at the door of <i>The Cock and Bull</i> in Fleet Street,
the Major had thanked them for the honour of their friendship,
and, with a rending hiccup, had started amidst street urchins on his
solemn homeward procession in this guise early in the afternoon,
they had clung to each other and had wept with laughter, hysteric
at the splendour of their humour. Nay, it provoked a mighty thirst
and much recounting of whimsical details in drinking shops for a
long day. The story grew.... But now that he was arrived in
his own street, the pestering swarm of street-urchins that buzzed at
the Major&#8217;s straying heels feared the joke was cracked&mdash;yet they
were loath to give up the tattered shreds of it whilst there was a
guffaw left to them. The point of honour during the journey
had been to get in under the play of the Major&#8217;s cane, and pluck
a strip off his shirt-tails; it had been a running fight as long as he
tramped the streets, the victory now with the boys, now with the
Major&#8217;s lunge of cane; but the gallant officer stood at last before
his stronghold, and his back was to it. A bloody nose or so amongst
the boys showed that the old soldier had not wholly lost the
cunning of a heavy hand.</p>

<p>Yet he was vaguely troubled where he stood. He questioned
his ability to mount the steps unaided&mdash;and mount them he must
before he could achieve the ringing of the bell; he feared also that
it would involve the turning of his back upon the enemy. With
masterly coolness of judgment, he decided to wait until somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
came to the house, and then to conduct his retreat, under cover of
their entry, to the citadel.</p>

<p>A crowd collected.</p>

<p>It was at this dramatic pause that the landlady and her daughter,
returning from envious viewing of the Quality rolling by in the
Park, came upon the scene.</p>

<p>The Major, with wonted gallantry, and a somewhat wide miss or
two of his hand at the object, swept off his hat; but the effort lost
him his legs, and he suddenly sat upon the steps&mdash;the hat flinging
out into the road, where it was rushed off with a wild whoop
by triumphant urchins and became the football of a fierce
game, in which many goals were kicked over neighbouring lamp-posts.</p>

<p>The two women, brushing their skirts aside, passed by the
fallen Major haughtily. He made a vigorous effort to go up the
steps on all fours after the ladies; he reached the topmost as they
slammed the door in his face.</p>

<p>He sat on the doorstep, and shook his head sadly....</p>

<p>Thus Anthony Baddlesmere found him.</p>

<p>Anthony was slackening his pace, hesitant, wondering how to
avoid the embarrassment of getting into the house&mdash;there was
the rustle of a girl&#8217;s dress as she flipped past him, light feet ran up
the steps, and Betty, ringing the bell, stooped down, gave her
father her arm, and, as he struggled to his feet, led him into the
yawning doorway.</p>

<p>Anthony stepped in after them; and the door was shut.</p>

<p>He felt a sudden sense of shame that he had allowed the girl to
do what he himself had a little feared to do; and he helped her now
to get her father up the stairs and into his room. Arrived thereat
and entering, she led the poor dazed soul to an armchair, settled
him there comfortably, with mother hands, then went to the
windows and flung them open. When she turned, it was to find
two angry women in the room&mdash;the landlady and her daughter
had entered without leave or asking, and instantly began a torrent
of upbraiding.</p>

<p>Betty went to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;He cannot understand now&mdash;better come to-morrow morning,&#8221;
she said gently; and they, opening the door, conquering
a stubborn desire to stay, slowly went out.</p>

<p>Anthony hesitated, not quite knowing what to do.</p>

<p>He looked at the girl.</p>

<p>The firm mouth was set; but there was no sign of complaint
nor of anger upon her.</p>

<p>He felt a certain meanness in the object of the journey from
which he was just returned.</p>

<p>The poor drunken man began to upbraid himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, father,&#8221; said the girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He hiccupped:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very drunk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why deny it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, father! that you should have come out into the day at
last!... I have feared this&mdash;for years.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>He tearfully protested that he never tasted any drink stronger
than coffee before the sun set&mdash;and this came of breaking his
principles.</p>

<p>The girl laughed sadly, and went to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said Anthony at last&mdash;&#8220;can I do nothing for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His will is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was acquiring knowledge of the world early, this girl&mdash;and
at first-hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning, Major Modeyne read a letter at breakfast,
and having read it, watching Betty furtively out of the corners of
his eyes, he stealthily took advantage of her attention being fixed
upon the tea-making to put the letter into his pocket.</p>

<p>It was a discomforting, abusive, cruel letter, and it said that he
and his daughter received notice to vacate their rooms that day
week&mdash;that there would be a cab waiting for them and their
baggage as soon as it was dark, and that they must go, even if the
law were employed to eject them.</p>

<p>It stated what it had to say harshly, vulgarly, blatantly. It
was not the kind of letter that raises a man&#8217;s self-respect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The week passed.</p>

<p>The Major had never been gayer, more debonair. He glittered.
He was a very sun. When he returned at night few knew. But
the mornings saw him blithe and tuneful.</p>

<p>The landlady and her daughter began to feel qualms. Still,
they hardened their hearts; and it was not until the morning of
the last day of the grace given him that the Major alluded to the
unpleasant affair.</p>

<p>He sent the little maid-of-all-work to say that he wished to see
the ladies if they could spare him five minutes&mdash;it would only take
three. He was ushered into their little sitting-room with all the
formalities he himself observed with so rigid an etiquette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Major!&#8221; The landlady broke an embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I received a letter a week ago for which I
have expected a formal apology. It has not been tendered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ladies stiffened, ruffled.</p>

<p>The elder said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Modeyne, we hope you do not intend to make us use
pressure to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No lady&#8217;s pressure has ever met rebuff from me,&#8221; said the
Major gallantly. &#8220;I would meet the lady half way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daughter sniffed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Major, you are pulling ma&#8217;s leg,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, madam,&#8221; said the Major&mdash;&#8220;this is no place for her
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to be funny, Major,&#8221; said the young woman
huffily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, most serious. For, were I to show indignation in
my denial I should cast aspersion on a handsome limb; were I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
fail in denying the soft impeachment I should entangle the limb
in the moralities. You place me in the unhappy position known
as the quandary. I can only escape from that position by saying
that I have every confidence in your mother, and that it is my
habit to keep her comely figure out of the gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lor, Major&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what you are getting at!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I have pulled nothing,&#8221; said the Major solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the Major&mdash;&#8220;I came for the apology.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; said the young woman tartly.</p>

<p>The Major bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, madam, is a matter of taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman tossed her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to go to a school of manners, Major Modeyne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major bowed again:</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is illegal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The women looked at each other uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said the daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be alarmed, ladies; I did not say libellous. God
forgive me, it is not that. But it contains instructions about my
daughter that cannot hold in the law. My daughter has done
nothing deserving of censure; and it is utterly out of your power
to eject her from her room. The notice to quit rests with my
daughter&mdash;and it is my intention that it shall always so rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger woman sniffed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Major,&#8221; said she, &#8220;no one wants to give Miss Betty a shade
of trouble&mdash;but <i>you</i> must leave at dark to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, if I go, I go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Major; but if you don&#8217;t go, the drawing-room floor
says she will leave&mdash;and others in the house are getting restless&mdash;and
we cannot afford the loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major pondered upon the problem long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the drawing-room floor is serious&mdash;she is a
woman of weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlady tittered.</p>

<p>But the daughter frowned her to order, and said, somewhat to
the point:</p>

<p>&#8220;She pays her way handsomely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>He sang, <i>Sigh no more, ladies</i>, as he sallied up the stairs; and to
the profound astonishment of the two puzzled women he did not
stir from the house that day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it was dark, a servant was sent upstairs to the Major to
tell him that the cab stood at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; bawled the Major from within.</p>

<p>An hour passed.</p>

<p>The maid was again sent upstairs to tell the Major that the cab
was waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it wait,&#8221; cried the Major.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Another hour passed.</p>

<p>The cabman became unpleasant, and uttered obscene prose.</p>

<p>The two ladies of the house, in support of each other, now went
up the stairs and knocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; cried the Major gaily.</p>

<p>They went in.</p>

<p>He was in bed.</p>

<p>The younger woman burst into tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing packed, ma,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth have you been doing all day, Major Modeyne?&#8221;
gasped the landlady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitying the lady who has the drawing-room,&#8221; said the Major.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what on earth she will do!&#8221; said the Major.</p>

<p>The younger woman bridled, sniffingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; she said hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the Major&mdash;&#8220;just like me&mdash;just like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; she said testily. &#8220;Well, we shall see. The cab has
been waiting for you for two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most patient cabman!&#8221; said the Major&mdash;&#8220;and who will pay
the cabman, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We intend to accompany you and your baggage to that cab
<i>now</i>,&#8221; said the young woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Major&mdash;&#8220;for I haven&#8217;t a stitch on
me; and here I stay in bed until your extremely tasteless letter
of a week ago is formally withdrawn.... Good-night, ladies.
Allow me to open the door for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He made as though to jump out of bed.</p>

<p>The two women hurriedly left the room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They went to the drawing-room, knocked and entered, sat down
on chairs and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>The stout lady of that realm went and held their hands;
soothed them; and heard their story out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&mdash;what are we to do, madam?&#8221; said they.</p>

<p>The stout lady laughed until the tears came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you two women can&#8217;t lead a naked man into a cab,&#8221;
said she; &#8220;I should love to see it, but I&#8217;m afraid you will never
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They began to weep again.</p>

<p>The old lady grew impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the man alone,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>And she added, blowing her nose:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have loved that creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, Major Modeyne was always the gentleman&mdash;even at bay
with the Inevitable.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which tells, with quite Unnecessary Frankness, of what chanced at
the Tavern of</i> &#8220;The Cock and Bull&#8221; <i>in Fleet Street</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the dining-room of <i>The Cock and Bull</i> was laughter, and the
clink of glasses, and some hiccup&mdash;for the dinner was long since
at an end, and the guests held much wine&mdash;not wholly without
giddiness and the confusion of tongues. There was more than a
hint of Babel.</p>

<p>It was the feast of Saint Valentine&#8217;s Day, and the commercial
gentlemen, fore-gathered there, made the sentiment at <i>The Cock
and Bull</i> this night sacred to the Ladies.</p>

<p>Major Modeyne, being in the chair, sat at the head of the table;
and a-down it, along both sides, were city men; and at the end
of all the poetic, sallow, and vague-eyed landlord of the tavern,
who, so repute wagged a whispering tongue, had not been above
taking his Double First at Oxford&mdash;a vague prize to your ordinary
mortal that savours of the mysteries of Eleusis and a full hand of
trumps at the gaming-table of life, though &#8217;tis said to be useless
enough, being of the nature of fireworks in the grey fastnesses of
the skull. There&#8217;s something of the awesome in big names.
However that may be, our landlord was a gloomy fellow in his
cups, and ran to latinities, so that the wit came mostly from the
head, where was the Authority of the Chair&mdash;indeed, Modeyne had
repartee so long as he could keep an eyelid up, though fragments
of it had served the world of badinage before.</p>

<p>The debauch being dedicate to the ladies, then, our gloomy
landlord raised the glass to the respectable sentiment of <i>Sweethearts
and Wives</i>.</p>

<p>And, the toast being drunk, as indeed was the company, the
Chair, as an excuse to empty the glasses again, gave the toast of
retort, <i>Other Fellows&#8217; Sweethearts and Wives</i>&mdash;the hiccup which
was the full-stop to the Major&#8217;s waggery being drowned in a shout
of laughter and the noisy drinking of the toast. Indeed, they
stood up to it, one foot on chair and one on table, giving it with
musical honours, though, as the draper, a fellow of polygamous
sentiments from his own showing, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This standing on chairs displayed a childlike confidence in
the design of creation and man&#8217;s destiny under all conditions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
maintain the upright position on but two legs, that would have
done credit to a Sunday-school teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>He himself, reeling at his own dazzling elevation, grasped the
great lustre chandelier that depended from the ceiling, which,
flaring magnificently, gave way with him, so that he fell with it
amongst the wine-glasses; and whilst they plucked splinters of
broken glass from the lower end of him, he whimsically owned his
contrition at having tempted Providence by not sitting anchored
to the good seat that had been assigned to him. Still, said he,
commerce must follow the army; and the Major had the habit of
forlorn hopes, having acquired in youth and on the tented field
the taste for &#8220;withering fires&#8221; and &#8220;bloody engagements&#8221;&mdash;he
said this with all apologies&mdash;hiccup&mdash;to any churchwardens who
might be present&mdash;hiccup&mdash;but he <i>meant</i> bloody engagements.</p>

<p>As a fact, these commercial gentlemen adored the army and
navy&mdash;never were such fire-eaters as they. A tale of carnage, as
long as the old flag came out a-top, thrilled them and roused their
maddest enthusiasms. They thundered applause upon the heels
of the bloodthirsty sentiment. They were ready to die, so they
averred hiccuping, in their very cups for the divine right of their
king and the infallibility of the upper classes. Was never such
service of devotion as they swore to the &#8220;Thin Red Line&#8221; and
the &#8220;Handy Man.&#8221; Gods, it made the blood leap to hear them&mdash;they
were thirsting for self-sacrifice&mdash;each one of them. Indeed for
the dear old flag they were prepared to fling away Christianity&mdash;riches&mdash;suburban
villa&mdash;happy home&mdash;everything. The glasses
leaped to the thunder of their emotions.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, were they all aristocrat&mdash;hating the democracy
with a bitter hatred. The lord mayor&#8217;s coach drove at the slow
trot through all their varied ambitions, its golden caparisoned
horses making it to glitter a fixed star to their designs, a guide to
their hopes&mdash;and, from that, the ultimate step into the peerage,
riches, powdered footmen, and marble halls. It was all tucked
away tight behind the bloodshot eyes, in their secret imaginations.
When they went to bed at night, took off their trousers, and blew
out the light, the dream of these things passed in pageant along
the top of their foot-rails. To be a Nob&mdash;so they put it with
vulgar lip, when confessing to their own souls&mdash;that was the Ultimate
Thing. They believed in their God&mdash;a little hesitantly on
occasions; but their belief knew no wavering in the divine inspiration
of the statesmanship of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The polygamous draper but echoed the general sentiment when
he condemned the vulgarity of the masses.</p>

<p>The British workman had his whole contempt&mdash;(thus he delivered
himself)&mdash;the British workman did as little as he could,
and got a ridiculously high wage that was so much outside his
needs that he was always more or less drunk&mdash;hiccup&mdash;gen&#8217;rally
more&mdash;hiccup&mdash;in the public-house&mdash;hiccup hiccup&mdash;and the&mdash;gin-palace.
What did these gorgeous and brightly illuminated
drinking-saloons that shone in the darkness of the darkest street
mean but the widespread overpayment of the working-man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his consequently seeking in these costly pleasure-houses of vice,
when his so-called day&#8217;s work was done, his illicit&mdash;hiccup&mdash;illicit
joys.</p>

<p>Long and sustained applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hee-haw!&#8221; cooed the Major. &#8220;Too-ra-loora-lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draper turned upon him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer can&#8217;t get over it, sir&mdash;hiccup&mdash;<i>there</i> it is.&#8221; He swept his
hand towards the landlord: &#8220;There&#8217;s your workman&mdash;hiccup&mdash;and
there&#8217;s your public-house&#8221;&mdash;he swept his hand to the Major.</p>

<p>The Major rapped upon the table:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order! order!&#8221; cried he&mdash;&#8220;the chairman is <i>not</i> a public-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>He giggled, and titters turned to laughter.</p>

<p>The erotic draper sat down:</p>

<p>&#8220;The army keeps a-jumpin&#8217; on the bloomin&#8217; chest of commerce
to-night,&#8221; said he, &#8220;until I forget&mdash;hiccup&mdash;forget my intentions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major begged to remind the gentleman that this was not a
Labour night, but the Feast of St. Valentine, when even the
greyest sparrows skipped amorous with love&#8217;s delight along the
homely necessary waterspout.</p>

<p>The draper apologized handsomely; and they drank together.</p>

<p>The draper was now called upon, as a man of taste in the matter,
to make the speech of the evening: The Ladies&mdash;Lovely Woman.</p>

<p>He arose and spoke.</p>

<p>He apologized for having disturbed the harmony of the evening
by his earlier essay, but the British workman was the thorn in his
side&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A waggish commercial person, an atheistic upholsterer and
something of a rake, called out that they had all understood that
it was the splinter of a sherry glass that had been drawn from the
wound.</p>

<p>The Major rose and called for order&mdash;their honest draper only
used a metaphor, a So-to-Speak&mdash;besides, the splinter of glass had
not been removed from the gentleman&#8217;s side, nor by any stretch
of the imagination nor tribute to delicacy could it be called his
side. The affair of the wine-glass, and therefore all reference to
it, must be avoided&mdash;it was a painful subject, and the incident
was now closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haw-haw!&#8221; guffawed the rakish upholsterer. &#8220;But the
wound ain&#8217;t&mdash;it was our honest draper that re-opened the wound.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major&#8217;s eyes twinkled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order, order,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;The wound, sir, and the incident
are now closed. The subject before the house is Lovely Woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down.</p>

<p>The draper licked his lips sullenly, and proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, and he thrust his thumbs into the armholes
of his waistcoat, raising a drowsy eyebrow&mdash;&#8220;woman was
once content to <i>be</i>. Hiccup. To trip through the banquet of
existence appealing to man as the Beautiful; and, being beautiful,
to be loved&mdash;to sit on the knees of man and kiss him kisses.
She is no longer content. Woman has become a danger&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
menace&mdash;hiccup&mdash;a pronounced menace. Damn this hiccup!
Woman, I say, has become a menace to the State. Woman is no
longer content to be beautiful&mdash;she has come out into the noisy
thoroughfare of life and demands liberty to win her own career,
and to clean up that thoroughfare. I call it unwomanly. Yet
the men, like the asses they are&mdash;hiccup&mdash;are marrying them.
But, you know, I&#8217;m against blue-stockings&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Order!&#8221; cried the Major&mdash;&#8220;the ladies&#8217; underclothes are out
of order.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draper licked his lips and blinked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I withdraw the stockings,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;fancy, you and me,
gentlemen, mating with a female who knows as much as we do&mdash;fancy
the want of &#8217;armony there must be in the house where the
lady is our equal in intelligence and in the&mdash;all the other things
that go to make up a man&#8217;s natural superiority&mdash;hiccup.... I&#8217;m
against this Pallas Athene business myself&mdash;the woman putting
on the blooming helmet and coming out and criticising conduct.
It&#8217;s indelicate. It takes the bloom off the peach of her modesty.
Not, mind you, that I&#8217;m one as plumps too solid for modesty.
Not at all. I don&#8217;t go nap on modesty. For my part, I like a
woman who can take her buss like a live thing&mdash;as women were
meant by God&#8217;s design so to do. A woman who draws the line at
honest kissing is no woman at all&mdash;and is of the nature of a public
nuisance. A woman who is cold-blooded enough to write sonnets
to her love when she might be sitting on his knees and loving her
love is committing an offence against her Original Intention&mdash;which
is a sin against nature. I ask you, then, gentlemen, to fill
your glasses and drown Modesty....&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Major takes to his Bed</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter dawdled late in the city.</p>

<p>Saint Valentine went out into the darkness of the night, with
silent feet muffled in a heavy fall of snow.</p>

<p>And Major Modeyne went with him.</p>

<p>They brought him home in the early morning, dead and icy
cold, and laid him upon his bed; and when they were gone Betty
sat by the still figure and stroked the chill hand that had done
intentional ill to none; in such strange manner she tasted for the
first time the bitterness of death&mdash;in such sorry fashion the poor
tattered remains of her childhood fell from her, sitting there,
listening for the deep mystic significance of the eternal slaying
that is a part of the eternal life....</p>

<p>Betty, as by pronounced habit, was to suffer for it.</p>

<p>A jury had to sit upon the tragedy; and the coroner, embarrassedly
enough, had to rake up the details that were called the
life of the poor broken man that lay silent in death, unheeding and
unprotesting and unashamed. Modeyne&#8217;s hand had always fallen
heaviest upon the small child from whom his thin will would have
the most flinched as to the giving of pain. His death, that should
have closed the book of the record of the child&#8217;s struggles against
the public washing of the linen of his sordid details of life, was
instead a new whip wherewith she was scourged&mdash;the manner of
it was the very event that compelled the uncovering of all those
little tragedies which the proud child had so courageously hushed
under the dignity of her silence.</p>

<p>It was made clear by the sworn evidence that the Major had
wandered to the great flight of steps on which he was found, that
he had taken off his boots to prevent the waking of his landlady,
that he had climbed a few of the steps in the darkness, and lain
down, under the delusion that he was in bed, and had slept into
death, the white snow weaving his winding-sheet.</p>

<p>Then it came out that he had sat late at a festive orgy in the
rooms of <i>The Cock and Bull</i> tavern in Fleet Street, and had left the
place, like most of the others, somewhat vague as to his destination.</p>

<p>It also came out that he was some sort of agent for the tavern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which had wine-merchandise in its connection; but this seems to
have become, in the Major&#8217;s case, but a sleeping partnership&mdash;his
chief office having been an ornate one&mdash;to attract the city loungers
to the place by the exercise of his genial and ready fancy and his
pleasant friendship, which was wholly untainted with the ignoble
thing called snobbery. The very waiters felt in him a personal loss.
Yet he had not had the means to be prodigal of anything but his
whimsical tongue.</p>

<p>It was also hinted that the dead man was highly connected&mdash;but
the magnificent in their high places kept a frigid silence that
showed a dogged decision to bear their loss unflinchingly.</p>

<p>Indeed, on the evening of the day on which the dead man was
put to his rest for the last time by the silent girl and the handsome
youth who had so often shared the task in the small hours of the
morning when the unknowing world snored and slept, it was,
truth to say, a somewhat vulgar little knot of city men that sat
round the table of <i>The Cock and Bull</i> tavern and passed a silk hat
round about to collect the little sum that one of them was
deputed to take to the girl herself with a vote of their respect
and affection for a dead friend and as true a gentleman as any
into whom the good God had put good wine.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Tom Folly blunders along in his Self-centred Gig&mdash;and
drags a Dainty Little Lady&#8217;s Skirts into the Wheel</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> fretted at the death of the Major&mdash;fretted at the
publicity&mdash;fretted at the time of the man&#8217;s dying, and the
manner; for he had decided to appeal to Betty not to spoil
Noll&#8217;s prospects, now so suddenly brightening, by getting him
entangled in a childish engagement. But Modeyne&#8217;s death
made it wholly indecent to approach the already so indecent subject
for some time; made it in any case the more difficult to
broach at all; made it also more urgent that it should be approached.
And, to fret the will with further indecision, Anthony,
his eyes intent upon the pale girl in the simple black gown, and
balked by the strange gravity that had settled upon the slim
dainty figure, perceived the exquisite approach, the delicate
fragrance and most subtle atmosphere of the coming of womanhood&mdash;an
atmosphere which made it doubly difficult for him to
commit himself to putting into the brutality of speech what cost
him shame even in the thinking.</p>

<p>Had he only taken Caroline into his scheme, he would not have
blundered thus clumsily into a brutality; but he did not&mdash;and,
with his fatal capacity for not leaving well alone, fretting impatiently
through the keen bitter winds of March and the early
days of April, he at last brought himself to the pitch of seeing the
girl alone and making his appeal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Anthony knocked at the door and entered her room, she
arose, with a smile, to greet him; and he found himself mute.</p>

<p>She was so comely, this slender girl of fifteen years, so debonair&mdash;as
is meet and fit in the young of the most beautiful of all
created things. The brown hair, tied with a ribbon at the nape
of the white neck, showed the great beauty of the shapely head;
and he knew that the soul within the delicate body was the
most mystically beautiful of all. He realized that the slightest
cruelty would leave harsh scars. Yet he did not withhold
himself from the brutalities.</p>

<p>She would have made him at ease so prettily; and he decided
to be blunt and strike at once, if he would say what he had come
to say.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have come to say a thing which it hurts
me to the quick to say; which of course must wound you even
more. Don&#8217;t make it an added bitterness to me by being too
much your dainty self&mdash;rather be unpleasant&mdash;if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light went out of the trustful grey eyes; the smile flickered
out and slowly left the pure face. The slender hands trembled a
little&mdash;the large eyelids fell, and she bowed her comely head.
She wondered what new agony lay in store for her.</p>

<p>Thus she stood and said never a word. Just one little movement&mdash;the
interlacing of the slender fingers together before her&mdash;it
hid the trembling of the white hands&mdash;and she prepared to meet
what cut of the lash should fall, in silent dignity.</p>

<p>Anthony was taken up with his own difficulty,&mdash;yet, as he
spoke, the picture of the girl&#8217;s humiliation slowly bit into his
imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do not know whether you are aware of it,
but there are only two people between Noll, through his mother,
and Lord Wyntwarde of Cavil....&#8221; The lash cut deep, but he
was too engrossed in his object to see the girl&#8217;s courage. &#8220;Lord
Wyntwarde is, frankly, somewhat of a brute&mdash;capricious, full of
whims. He has, after ignoring the boy from his birth, suddenly
expressed a wish that Noll should go to Oxford, a wish also to
provide a career for him&mdash;such as&mdash;I&mdash;cannot give him....
He has made, as one of his conditions, a most binding proviso that
Noll shall not marry without his consent, nor outside his set&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl spake no smallest word, gave no sign.</p>

<p>Anthony went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to ask you not to spoil Noll&#8217;s career&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The words cut into the girl&#8217;s very flesh; but she said not a word.</p>

<p>Anthony blundered on, brutally unconscious of the simple
urgent fact that the girl had not wanted to spoil the lad&#8217;s career,
that she was in no way on her defence&mdash;that he was committing
himself to the base insolence, the most ignoble insolence of which
we can be guilty, of the lie that presumes the accusation of the
innocent. It were as though indifferent cutlery should beg
tempered steel to try and be tempered steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very beautiful,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;you probably do not
realize how beautiful. And I am going to appeal to you not to
allow Noll to get engaged to you in case he should wish it&mdash;for it
would be folly in me to pretend that I don&#8217;t see that he has a boy&#8217;s
love for you, which, if other things were different, God knows
would be the happiest thing for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he blundered on, excusing the girl from his own insolences;
even making all allowances for her out of the deeps of his self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s fingers remained tight clasped before her&mdash;her head
bowed down&mdash;but she made no slightest movement, standing
deathly still.</p>

<p>And Anthony, his false step irretrievably made, realized slowly
that he had done a brutal and foolish thing; saw perhaps even
more clearly that he had won a success; but, rebuffed by the girl&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
silence at last, and embarrassed and not without a suspicion of
shame, he slowly retired from the room.</p>

<p>The door closed upon him.</p>

<p>The girl was left utterly alone.</p>

<p>A hot flush had burnt into her face.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand and with difficulty reached the
mantel.</p>

<p>They had now turned even her deep love for this youth, the only
being left to her, into a thing to bring her shame. It was the
whip of scorpions.</p>

<p>She had stood and taken the lashes upon her slender shoulders;
but at last the hellish device that invented the punishment of the
solitary cell wrung from her lips a pathetic little moan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Dainty Little Lady, looking out of the Window of a Shabby
Home at a Shabbier Destiny, joins the Streaming Crowd whose
Faces pass in the Street, drifting towards the Strange Riot of
Living</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first time, Betty reeled beneath the buffets of her destiny&mdash;for
a moment the world swung away from before her feet&mdash;she
clutched the mantel, or would have fallen.</p>

<p>Passing her slender hand over her head, uttering a pitiful little
moan, with the courage of her blood she stood at gaze with the
cruelty&mdash;faced it&mdash;and overcame it....</p>

<p>Practising her wonted and deliberate caution, she considered
her next move; before the dusk had taken possession of the town
she was dressed for walking; she went out to the shops to buy
some needful frills and stuff; she brought the package home with
her, and locked herself into her room.</p>

<p>It had come to her that morning, indeed she had been at work
upon the problem but a few hours before this last blow had been
struck at her, that she must still further narrow her narrow expenditure.</p>

<p>All that night Betty sewed, her deft fingers lengthening one of
her gowns.</p>

<p>When she had done, the chill dawn was stealing up the smoky
heavens.</p>

<p>She put out the lamp, and packed.</p>

<p>The memories would come crowding, treading on each other&#8217;s
heels importunately. Betty remembered only the happinesses;
and these, because they made her lip tremble, she put from her
with stern and dogged fortitude, bending her wits only on the
details of her coming actions, on the things she must do; and it
was thus that, when the time came, every move she made fitted
into its calculated place with appointed precision, and she was
prepared for every event before it nudged at her attention.</p>

<p>The sun was well up, and yawning housemaids clumsily astir,
before she had put away her last little belongings in the big black
trunk. Even at her tender years she had learnt in the harsh
school of experience the value that the world sets upon the having
of possessions, and the credit that landlords give to such as show
responsible luggage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Wisdom is thrust upon some at sixteen.</p>

<p>The room looked sadly desolate when she had put away the last
of her small belongings; and it was with a strenuous effort that
she sat down before the mirror and gathered up and coiled her nut-brown
hair about her head for the first time. She stared wide-eyed
at the years it added to her age.</p>

<p>She dressed herself in her lengthened gown; put on her hat and
jacket. When she was finished she stood before the glass a
woman&mdash;and a very beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Yet her brows clouded&mdash;at the dread that she looked too young!</p>

<p>She wrote a short note to her landlady to say she might be away
all day; stole stealthily on to the landing to see that there was no
one about; locked her door; put the key in her pocket; ran
down the stairs; and let herself out into the street....</p>

<p>All day she spent in the purlieus of Soho, in the search for a
room; and it was near upon nightfall when she made a choice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When darkness had come down upon the street, Betty drove
up to the door of her old home in a cab; she took the hungry
tatterdemalion of a cabman upstairs for her baggage; and, whilst
the shabby fellow was getting it down and on to the cab, she herself
sought out the landlady in her little office. She put the money
for her rooms into the hands of the amazed woman, tried to tell her
that she was going away, and broke down into a hoarse murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go-ing away?&#8221; gasped the good creature.</p>

<p>Betty squeezed the old body&#8217;s hand. She could say nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Betty,&#8221; said the other&mdash;&#8220;you mustn&#8217;t go away....
What will the house be without you? Pay when you can, my
dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girl shook her head sadly. She was glad to find that
they would only think she had left for lack of means.</p>

<p>The old woman patted her shoulder, thrust back the money into
her purse, and said that nothing on God&#8217;s earth would prevail on
her to touch it. She kissed the unhappy girl; and Betty, making
a stern effort to check her sobs, stood up, kissed the old face on
each cheek, stepped out into the night, and was gone....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll had knocked impatiently at the locked door twice that day,
and now as the darkness fell, seeing the door open, he leaped up the
stairs, calling Betty by name; sprang through the open door; and
came to a sudden halt, bewildered to find the room deserted and
dismantled.</p>

<p>He turned roughly to the landlady&#8217;s daughter, who stood at the
window weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Modeyne?&#8221; he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; sobbed the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows, Mr. Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll went to the little bed, flung himself down beside it, and
sobbed like a child....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>The landlady&#8217;s daughter slipped a-tiptoe from the room and
brought down the young fellow&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>Caroline went and seated herself on the bed beside the lad, and
stroked the handsome head with her gentle fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;so you too are to taste the bitters of
life early!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow stayed by the bed all night, and would not be
comforted.</p>

<p>And Caroline most wisely stayed with him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Dawning Womanhood whispers that Dolls are Dolls</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty,</span> listless and lonely, and in hiding, had not been long in
her new-found attic when she won the wan smile of a little old
faded lady who lived in the room below.</p>

<p>They met on the stairs; and a smile bred a smile. A formal
invitation to tea from the little old faded lady followed. The
little scented note bore the signature of Flora Jennyns....</p>

<p>When Betty entered the room, and shut the door, she shut out
half a century.</p>

<p>Miss Flora Jennyns, rustling in full-skirted silks, had the
atmosphere of crinolines round and about her; the room was
fresh and sweet, and fragrantly quaint and stilted, and of the
early Victorian years.</p>

<p>Into the armchair before the fire where she was used to sit,
Betty made the little lady now go; and the girl went and sat on
a footstool by her knees and talked to her, and entered into the
dainty faded mind.</p>

<p>She saw, with a little smile, that Miss Flora Jennyns at once
fell into a little pose&mdash;it was the faded reflection of a portrait that
hung on the wall&mdash;the picture of a graceful simple young woman
who leaned her chin on a pretty slender hand, as she sat wrapt in
dreams of sweet sentiment; and slowly, from out the faded lines
of the old face and head and pose, there came to her the features
and pose, modest and virginal, of the portrait.</p>

<p>Whilst Betty made tea for her, she learnt that the little old
Catholic lady had been a literary success in her youth&mdash;a one-time
vogue, who was now fading away in the heroic pride of a gentlewoman&#8217;s
penury&mdash;uncomplaining&mdash;amidst a sordid world and
harsh needs dreaming of romance that had walked in crinolines&mdash;living
in a withered garden where were but fragrant fallen
leaves....</p>

<p>From that day, the little Miss Flora&#8217;s smile became more frequent;
and from Betty&#8217;s attic the bleak loneliness lifted and went
out; for, though the vasty gulf of age divided them (youth and
old age can only love each other as in a dream, vaguely), the girl
did not find so much time for brooding&mdash;she had found a something
to mother....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Betty, looking out of her attic window, began to notice that, as
twilight fell, a little old gentleman would slowly pace the street
opposite; and the little faded old lady, dressed for the road,
would go out and meet him, and, after old-world courtesies exchanged
between them, she would take his proffered arm and so
together they would take their little walk abroad.</p>

<p>Betty came to know him, with a smile, as the Man of Pallid
Ideals.</p>

<p>He would bring Miss Flora to the door always; ring the bell for
her; and with elaborate bow and hat in hand, there take leave of
her. Nearer to the lady&#8217;s room he never ventured, neither being
provided with a chaperon....</p>

<p>Betty one day taxed Miss Flora with the charge that she was
in love&mdash;and loved a poet. And the little withered waxen cheeks
blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall read his poems, my dear,&#8221; she said; and, rising,
she went to a little sandal-wood box, opened the lock with an
ornate little key, and, raising the lid, let out the scent of the
lavender in which was laid a little book of verse amidst other
treasures.</p>

<p>Miss Flora handed the little volume to Betty; and she, begging
her to leave the box open, said she would only read the precious
book in that room.</p>

<p>Miss Flora kissed her, and went back to her chair.</p>

<p>Betty, sitting in the window in the waning light, learnt from
the precious volume that the poet&#8217;s name was Cartel de Maungy;
and opening the book she found written upon every leaf in tuneful
verse the self-revelation of the man, the poet of faded ideals, as
his race had been before him&mdash;his grandsire had gone to the guillotine
for a well-turned sonnet about something that did not matter.
On every page was the tale of his placid devotion; his adoration
of his Flora&mdash;always from a seemly distance; his vows that
they should ever move in the ideal; that the touch of his lips
upon her fingers is sweet marriage enough for him; in his
measured singing of jewelled queens and sapphire nights and
pearly dusk he holds her finger-tips reverently and but for the
moment, and that only in the distant and proper measure of the
gavotte or the like stately trippings to the whispered music of viol
and lute and harpsichord&mdash;throughout was no coarse bucolic love-embrace.
Thus the slender verse sounded its tender music until
there was almost shame in the kiss that is kissed upon the mouth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little old faded lady was possessed of an academic and
dainty old-world Papist faith that √¶sthetically touched Betty&#8217;s
sense of beauty.</p>

<p>The child had grown up without any kind of formal religious
instruction&mdash;had picked up from the air, and from straying truths
in the air, her sweet concept of life. The pure metal of her quick,
alert and vigorous understanding required but little hammering.
Only with the lad Noll had come unrest and questioning.</p>

<p>Major Modeyne had drifted from his Church&mdash;indeed, Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
remembered well a very severe fit of coughing that had overcome
him in answer to an early childish demand of hers during a
thunderstorm as to what God could find to do all day in heaven&mdash;coughing
which became almost an apoplectic fit when, being
unanswered, she concluded airily that the drab intercourse with
pious people and the lack of good wholesome entertainment excused
these outbursts of anger and violence, and no doubt led to
the making of these noises and other suchlike unpleasantnesses.</p>

<p>Betty, with the strange reserve that covered all her deepest
thinking, whispered no hint of her own birth in the same faith to
the old lady; she tried instead to win from the beautiful and pure
and faded mind of Miss Flora some conception of God and the
mysteries&mdash;only to find the little old lady&#8217;s concept, for all the
disguises of her delicate mind, exceedingly crude and vague&mdash;that,
in fact, she had absolutely no concept at all. She saw that it was
the wide compassion of the mystic Man of Sorrows that gave, as
to most Papists, the exquisite faith in their mysteries. Yet, like
the most orthodox, she spoke of the old and the new dispensation&mdash;God
then had not known His own mind. Puzzled with the
great fact that God and Son were absolutely destructive of each
other&mdash;one the God of War, the other the God of Peace&mdash;one the
God of Vengeance, demanding Punishment, the other the God of
Mercy, offering Forgiveness; the one choosing an indifferent race
as a chosen people, the other rejecting that race; the book of the
laws of the one obliterating the book of the laws of the other&mdash;the
girl had awakened from her childhood and realized that she had
eaten of the fruit of knowledge, and that before the judgment-seat
of that knowledge the God of her childhood stood convicted of the
very sins, from killing downwards, for which that same God had
condemned man to eternal punishments; and, with the true instinct
for justice and for the humanities, she forthwith rejected the
God and gave all her affection to the Christ, who had thwarted,
and by thwarting had confessed the injustice of God.</p>

<p>And now, having so decided, and being in sight of a calm harbour
of refuge, she found herself baffled with the fury of the factions
that professed the Christ. The symbolism and the beauty of the
Papist section beckoned her to Rome; but the genius of the child
saw all things in the large, and was not to be led aside by details&mdash;she
was repelled by the contradictions of its belief that at one
turn appealed to reason, at the next rejected reason; repelled by
its un-Christliness, repelled by the submission of the conscience
to its priesthood, repelled by its condemnation of all outside its
gates, repelled by its preposterous claims&mdash;by its belief in the real
presence of the Christ in the wine and wafer of its sacraments.</p>

<p>She had only that day come upon a copy of the Cautels, and as
she read the cautions to priests, after partaking of the sacraments,
that they should not wash their mouths or spit before breaking
their fast in case of ejecting the body of Christ in their spittle or
vomit, she was stung with shame that such puerile things should
be expected of her intelligence&mdash;it were as though she had been
struck across the face with a whip. The strong blood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
master race leaped in her veins, and she found herself unable to
believe that the toys which had amused her infancy were really
alive.</p>

<p>To all the pettiness of the little petty quarrels that were galling
the dignity of the age, her clear intellect was too contemptuous to
give more than a passing thought. The symbols and the forms,
the chief source of the wrangles and squabblings, were no trouble
to her, had the things on which they were founded been deep and
large with truth. With the greyness of mind, that made of these
things a sin, she had no more sympathy than with the narrowness
of head that made of them an important part of life....</p>

<p>She had wandered one day into a Quakers&#8217; meeting-house&mdash;had
been struck with the deep religious atmosphere, the far deeper
mysticism than that of her own Church, for all its splendid forms
and ceremonial and great beauty of service. She had not felt her
reason sullied by the interposition of any gross human body
between the Christ and her nobility. She had felt the wondrous
dignity of the simple service, in spite of the greyness.</p>

<p>She had read of late a novel, a vulgar stupid book, in which a
child brought up by an agnostic is made to commit suicide because
it cannot believe in a hereafter&mdash;in hell. Her reason revolted at
the shabby trick, for she saw that no child would commit suicide
because there was not a hell; but rather because there was&mdash;indeed,
she herself remembered that she had suffered torments at
night and had wept until her nerves were shaken for fear of hell,
and out of compassion for the poor lost souls&mdash;nay, had reeled
before the brutality that had created these poor souls only to fling
them to such hellish predestined doom for all eternity. This
literary trash roused her to the feeble foundations of sand on
which much so-called religious life is built&mdash;especially the religious
side of women. For the book had a wide sale.</p>

<p>Creeds are an affair of race. They that are of a master race
will hold a master creed&mdash;they that are of a sloven race will bow
to sloven gods. It is the attribute of a slave people to pay homage
from fear. This girl was of the master peoples. It was impossible
for her to enslave her mind or her body or her soul with the
blind credulities. She was of the mighty race that has bred the
Protestors. With the passing of her childhood she put away the
toys of the childhood of the world. In no bitter or harsh temper,
but with affection and sadness she put them away&mdash;and took a
deeper breath of life.</p>

<p>In monastic cells and blind gropings in dark corners where life
is a denial, and in the shirking of contradictions, very God is not
to be found; but out in the free fresh air of the great world. The
truth cannot lie.</p>

<p>The girl roused in the dusk of the dying day and took the beautiful
image of the Mary, and went down with it to the little old
faded lady&#8217;s room, and set it upon the mantel there, that it might
bring happiness to one whose sweet mind had not passed beyond
these things.</p>

<p>And she, little and old and faded, seated before the fire, smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
when the girl had set above her hearth the emblem of her outworn
creed. When the tall slender girl went and sat down beside the
flounced and emaciated old knees a pathetically weary old hand
was stretched out and rested on the brown hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of God,&#8221; sighed the withered lips, &#8220;I am so glad not to
be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the girl parted from her image of the Mary, she left the
childhood of her intellect behind her.</p>

<p>And from that day, Betty raised her frank honest eyes to the
facts and verities of the live world about her, and, as she nearest
might, fearlessly and cheerfully lived her own sweet life foot to
foot and eye to eye with the mystic realities of her appointed
destiny, mistaking guesses for truth never.</p>

<p>For it is through the humanities alone, be ye sure of this, that
we may touch the hem of the garment of God.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Mr. Pompey Malahide loses his Breath in the Midst
of a Boast</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pompey Malahide,</span> man of considerable wealth as he had
been for years, was now grown so rich that he scarcely knew
whether each fresh venture in which he launched might not be
doubling his income by the end of the year.</p>

<p>City people said, awe-struck, that all he touched turned to
gold. But they failed to add that he touched nothing that did
not hold hidden treasure. As a fact, he ventured only in the
exploitation and invention of things of which he had himself
felt the lack, which he felt were wanted at large. His shrewd
business insight led him simply to traffic in such things as must
turn to gold on their very discovery. Whilst the unimaginative
followed a garish eyesight to seek fortune at the goldfields, he
stayed at home and won wealth from richer lodes. He did not
break hard rock for gold; he made the things that the world had
need to buy.</p>

<p>His appetite was but whetted by success.</p>

<p>He was now destined to make such wealth as is only dreamed
of in the dingy city offices of imaginative Jews.</p>

<p>Pompey Malahide was on the eve of becoming a millionaire.</p>

<p>Yet was he plagued with discontent.</p>

<p>He was suffering discomfort. Riches alone contained nothing
in themselves. He realized that riches were only a power. He,
in communion with himself, striding his room, stood himself by
the figure of young Bartholomew Doome, his paid servant; and
his vulgarly frank eyes could not rid him of the transparent fact
that this other was the master without an effort of his own. This
other was the designer&mdash;the creator. His own the rude hand
that beat out the design. Behind the dry humour and grim
smile of the young man was the master wit, a wit always strangely
kindly to him, but&mdash;tolerant. Whilst in the very act, even
whilst he puffed and blew and swaggered and strutted and
boasted to the young man of his successes and of his wealth,
the warmth ran out of his conceit&mdash;he felt that what would have
impressed his city friends was but rousing criticism behind those
calm eyes that cared no jot for elaborate wealth&mdash;eyes that looked
upon riches only as a secondary thing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Pompey Malahide looked at the slender sinewy hands of the
young man, and forthwith hid his own short thick hands with
their stunted pointed money-getting fingers behind his back.
He noticed that where they two entered a place together, all
deferred to the youth, whilst they were as rough to himself as he
to them. He noticed that Doome spoke with deference to those
below him whom he, Pompey, treated to the rougher side of his
tongue&mdash;noticed, too, that behind the youth&#8217;s courteous manner
was a note of calm authority that his own roughshod ways never
caught. He grasped the fact that money had not won him the
habit of the great; and he was determined that his girls should
have what he himself lacked&mdash;this easy and gracious bearing
of the master class. His boy was catching some hint of it at
Harrow. The girls must acquire it also.</p>

<p>But how?</p>

<p>He consulted Doome.</p>

<p>Doome, frowning upon the difficulties of the problem, decided
that these young women must have a young gentlewoman for
companion; he said that he would try and find a girl of breeding
of their own age; it was full time; the boy Horace was springing
up, and would be leaving Harrow at the end of the term; he
ought not to be brought up in a different social atmosphere to
the girls or he must of necessity drift into another set and grow
into contempt of his sisters.</p>

<p>Pompey Malahide nodded many nods.</p>

<p>He approved.</p>

<p>He sighed a portly sigh.</p>

<p>Riches were bringing perplexing burdens. The very spending
was a burden. He would have laughed at it all so short a while
ago. It was much easier to make wealth than to use it&mdash;for a
man had only to make money like a tradesman; he had to spend
it&mdash;like a gentleman.</p>

<p>Heigho!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pompey Malahide, approached by the leaders of the Opposition,
threw in his lot with the party, was put up for one of the
city constituencies, and, in the flood of political reaction that
swept the country, was elected to the House of Commons by a
large majority.</p>

dusk only; but the restriction began to fret her will; and she

<p>She decided to take the loyal Netherby Gomme into her confidence,
to put her position before him, and to rely on him to help
her in evading Noll and the Baddlesmeres. She hoped, too, that
he might get her some post of daily governess or companion to a
city family, or some secretarial billet in a city office.</p>

<p>She stole out one evening, and watched the Gommes&#8217; house
until she felt sure the place was free of visitors.</p>

<p>She tripped up the steps at last, plotting what she would say
if, by some chance, Noll should open the door.</p>

<p>When she rang the bell, she was answered by the old lady, who
was grimly rejoiced to see her.</p>

<p>Betty put the old lady into a smiling and important mood,
almost before the bang of the slammed door had ceased to echo
in the gloomy hall, by at once begging her to summon Netherby
downstairs to assist them in serious council on a delicate situation.</p>

<p>The grim old woman fussed away, important and bustling.</p>

<p>Netherby came with a smile on his long pale face, but the
happy glint was soon gone, its place usurped by something akin
to tears in his solemn steadfast eyes, as his melancholy features
took on their habitual lugubrious length and gloom, when he sat
down to discuss the situation&mdash;solemn promises of alliance and
secrecy being sworn and given.</p>

<p>He did not dare to tell Betty of the pathetic scenes that he had
gone through, in these very rooms, with the youth Noll; indeed,
Betty gave him little opportunity, for she showed no sense of
grievance, and passed, as lightly as could be, over the scene with
Noll&#8217;s father; but Netherby&#8217;s lips hardened, and showed an unwonted
severity during the reserved statement of the details
which had driven the girl to flight&mdash;he could fill in Anthony&#8217;s
phrases, and build upon the skeleton of his mind, all so unwitting
of its own limitations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>But to Betty, the air of this dingy house was cheerful to breathe&mdash;there
was in its very greyness a note of remembered gaiety&mdash;it
had sounded as she entered the place, at once she had heard
Noll&#8217;s feet on the stair, in the hall&mdash;she was amongst kindly
faces.</p>

<p>She was relieved, too, to find that Noll&#8217;s day was now very
fully occupied with work for a tutor. He was to enter at Magdalen
as soon as he could go up to Oxford.</p>

<p>She could now extend her hours of freedom and the range of her
walks without risk of meeting him. She knew when he would be
abroad, and where. During the old lady&#8217;s absence from the room,
it was arranged between Netherby and Betty that Julia was to
come and see her in the evenings as often as could be.</p>

<p>But Netherby&#8217;s keen wits were not deceived by the girl&#8217;s reservations.
He saw full well that she hungered for the slightest
news of Noll&mdash;hung upon the smallest details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before Betty left the house, she was the possessor of a letter of
introduction to a Mr. Pompey Malahide, in which her family and
connections were recited at a length that, had she known it,
would have embarrassed her as much as they were destined to
overwhelm the great man&mdash;a letter in which she was recommended
as an excellent friend and companion to the daughters of that
rich personage. This letter that she dropped into the post went
under cover to a personal friend of Netherby Gomme&#8217;s, and bore
the address of a certain Bartholomew Doome.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Great Financier is Satisfied with his Bargain</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> had dressed herself with elaborate care; yet she stood
before a large shop-window and frowned upon herself. She was
fretted with a doubt that she looked too young.</p>

<p>Ah, the quaint goals of the human! It is ever the itching
folly of the young to appear older; of the old to appear younger.</p>

<p>And the exceeding great beauty that faced the girl in the
mirrored world before her troubled her not at all. She was very,
very young.</p>

<p>So she turned on dainty heel and called a hansom&mdash;to drive
her to the elaborate mansion of Mr. Pompey Malahide, who had
his gorgeous dwelling amidst the rich who pay extortionately
for life in Park Lane. She shrewdly paid this, to her, heavy
toll upon her resources, for she knew, her instincts revealed,
what stupid people arrive at by mere mathematics and the
rebuffs of experience, that a man respects a woman who has the
air of rising, Venus-like, armed at all points from a sea of band-boxes.</p>

<p>Indeed, the girl&#8217;s manner and appearance, following upon the
weighty pronouncement of Doome&#8217;s introduction, dazzled the
city man, who rose to meet her, on her announcement by the
elaborate footman. Mr. Pompey Malahide had intended to
interview her seated at his desk; but a certain distinction and
that air aloof and apart and of another world that baffled
him in Doome, baffled him now. He stood up with the sudden
and unforeseen intention of trying to be a gentleman. From
lack of habit, he missed the trick, and at once fell into the first
position for taking an order, and became the deferential shopman.</p>

<p>And, to give him his due, his own dignities, or the crudities
that passed with him for such, were banished as at a stroke out of
his kindly bulk by the ambition which leaped within him that
this winsome young woman might transfer something of her
gracious bearing and pretty voice to his own two buxom
daughters. The very hope of it set his thick blood sounding
bassoon notes of delight in his ears, and the proud vision of it
went whirling through his emotions. It were as though he had
secured an estimate, and could have the work done at a price.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>From the moment the girl entered the room she was sure of
the post.</p>

<p>To her astonishment, she found the man vulgar; yet almost
his first comment had a strange note of good-taste that as much
surprised her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Modeyne,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that Mr. Bartholomew Doome
should recommend you is alone good enough for me.... But&#8221;&mdash;he
hesitated, a little embarrassed, and added with an effort&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
a rough man, and I hope I don&#8217;t make you misunderstand
me, but I have two girls, and I want you to be with them and
leaven them with your pretty ways; and if you will allow me to
do it in my own way, I would rather you did not enter this house
as a companion or a governess, for the girls would&mdash;take&mdash;well,
they would take the wrong way with you. If you would enter
my house as the daughter of a friend of friends of mine, come for
a long visit, I would pay you your fees without its being known
to them or anyone, and I think you yourself would be in a better
and pleasanter position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty thought over the scheme for a while; her strict code of
honour made her consider only the other value&mdash;of what she was
giving in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;perhaps it would be best.... May I see
the&mdash;girls, first?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pompey Malahide moved eagerly towards the bell, hesitated&mdash;came
back:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real glad to think it, Miss Modeyne,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but look
here, there&#8217;s another thing. I don&#8217;t want any schooling for them.
They are as old as you are, the more&#8217;s the pity&mdash;both gals have
got their hair up.... Ah,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;you would have been
the making of &#8217;em five years ago; you see&#8221;&mdash;he sighed again,
sadly&mdash;&#8220;they&#8217;ve modelled themselves a bit on me now....
Their mother never comes out of her boudoir. But what I was
going to say was this: you can tell &#8217;em what&#8217;s bad manners, and
go with them to picture-galleries and show them the good things,
can&#8217;t ye? and all that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can do that,&#8221; she said simply.</p>

<p>He nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I like to hear a gal say the name of the fellow
who did a picture without lookin&#8217; at the catalogue. And all
that sort of thing.... Make the girls smart, and knock some
sense into them.... They&#8217;re as good as gold&mdash;real warm-hearted
good gals. But they want style. And you can spare
them a ton of it&mdash;if you&#8217;ll excuse a rough and rather vulgar
fellow tellin&#8217; you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I should like to see the girls now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;before
we decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, bless ye,&#8221; said he, bustling to the door, and
walking out first. &#8220;Judith!&#8221; he bawled&mdash;&#8220;Mary!&#8221;</p>

<p>A girl&#8217;s voice called back:</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&#8220;Why do you bawl, father? Aren&#8217;t there servants enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>A door opened, and two young women entered the hall.</p>

<p>They were a couple of handsome girls, with a good swinging
swagger of the body, and held themselves aggressively in all the
trim comeliness of young womanhood, as though they could pay
their way and expected the men to cast a glance that same way.
Their full red lips were undisciplined; they were the outward
sign of their wills, they would do only what it pleased them to do.
No young and comely thing is wholly vulgar; and they were
young and comely.</p>

<p>The stout man&#8217;s bloodshot eyes watched the young girl&#8217;s face
keenly to read what passed on the first impression; but Betty
was not easy to read. She turned to him&mdash;was touched with
the anxious eagerness of his attitude:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said in a low voice&mdash;&#8220;I will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; bawled the millionaire&mdash;&#8220;here is Miss Betty Modeyne,
whose father was a friend of a great friend of mine&mdash;take her off
with you, and introduce her to your mother&mdash;she has come to
stay for a good long visit, if a soldier&#8217;s daughter can put up with
the dull house of a city man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two girls came and kissed Betty, and, taking her by the
arm, adored her. The young love the beautiful and the
young....</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Betty decided to keep on her little attic; and,
making a business visit the excuse, she went away for the afternoon
to purchase garments and brought back with her the black
dress-basket&mdash;that was largely filled with emptiness. But it had
a lock upon its emptiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, as the twilight fell, Mr. Pompey Malahide
burst in upon Bartholomew Doome, where he sat in the dusk of
his studio; the millionaire praised as lavishly as he spent money.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Doome, &#8220;I have never seen her; but I know all
about her.... There are so few beautiful women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the book,&#8221; said Mr. Pompey, swelling, &#8220;a marchioness,
sir&mdash;a marchioness. And a chit of a girl, too&mdash;ties her very
ribbons like a damn blue-blooded countess.... I wonder
where some women get it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome rose from his chair languidly, and strolled over to
the fussing excited man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord of advertisements,&#8221; said he, tapping the chest of the
other&mdash;&#8220;there is a book you do not read&mdash;it would baffle you as
Bradshaw&#8217;s railway guide baffles me. That book is called <i>The
Extinct and Dormant Peerage</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stout millionaire stared at him with questioning eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bartholomew Doome&mdash;&#8220;she comes out of that.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Gallant Major rises from the Dead</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">So,</span> for three several months, the summer shone gaily upon the
town, and passed away over the edge of the world in happy
fashion enough.</p>

<p>And Betty grew to some affection for the kindly rough man
who was the clumsy lord of this elaborate house. And out of
her liking grew an anxious and increasing fearfulness for the girls.</p>

<p>The rude father, hoping to polish diamonds, had sent the two
girls to a smart school at Brighton; and they, for lack of association
with his frank honesty of act and speech at home, and rebuffed
by the dull stupidity of a dowdy mother who scarcely ever
left her own room, and finding themselves balked by the discipline
of school, had fallen into the realizing of their desires by
crooked ways. Of their father&#8217;s qualities and open candour, of
his frankness of statement, they had only kept an outward semblance
that was little better than rudeness and bad manners, but
it deceived their father and his blunt honest friends; it was
thereby the more dangerous cloak for their intriguing and
questionable habits. They had gone to school vulgar and tolerably
honest; they had come back with some outward veneer of
manners, with much swaggering disdain, the aping of masterfulness,
a display of the lordly habit, and with souls utterly corrupt.
They had gone to school with rough affection for their father;
they had come back filled with critical contempt for him, ashamed
of him, and at heart afraid of him&mdash;dreading that he should discover
that they <i>were</i> afraid of him and ashamed of him. The
desires of their full red lips were without discipline, and fretted
at restraint; and they fed their desires unstintingly and gave
encouragement to every whim. They knew enough of the world
to recognise at a glance that Betty was above them by habit and
by breeding; they soon knew, by results, that her appearance
with them anywhere gave them distinction. Their utter lack
of all sense of honour embarrassed Betty at every turn. They
lied like drudges; and, with the conceit of the weak, they affected
an arrogance which they mistook for the habit of the master class,
not seeing that they were wholly devoid of the courage which
makes fearlessness of the truth the pronounced habit of the master
class.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Betty, watching their father with keen eyes, saw that he, too,
was strangely baffled.</p>

<p>He, poor man, looking to their old glad affection for him,
which had been their girlish return for his large love of them,
found instead, upon his hearth, that there were two critical young
women in possession; realized that his rough endearments were
coldly received.</p>

<p>He thought, as usual, that the fault was in his own manners.</p>

<p>The house, ordered by these girls in a spirit of lavish extravagance,
reeked of wealth.</p>

<p>The young women, innocent of that courtesy to servants which
makes of service an honourable act, were at constant and undignified
bickering and war with those beneath them; and as they
held always the winning card of dismissal, they never realized
that the sullen obedience of the world below stairs was as insulting
as open insolence; they still less realized that these sullen
flunkies took revenge in spoliation, and that what remained of
deference was a mockery and covert contempt. So it came about
that the sneaks amongst the servants held the lower quarters of
the house in their hands.</p>

<p>The young women now began to have social aspirations. They
had a vague idea that there was some strange pleasure to be got
in the mixing with and being seen with those who but gave them
chill encouragement to friendship. But as it so chanced, their
ambition for they knew not quite what, was fed by the sudden
eagerness of women of high social position to trespass on the broad
pages and in the social gossip of the columns of the widely read
newspaper which Pompey Malahide held at his beck and will&mdash;a
newspaper which diffused raucous opinions and created the
thoughts of millions throughout the country. The girls found
themselves courted. Their arrogance grew, and their strut and
swagger increased. Malahide dined at great houses.</p>

<p>With the master-will of Doome to advise him, Malahide now
found his position still further strengthened by the alliance with
and friendship of his boy Horace, who had left Harrow and was
going up to Oxford. His baffled affection for his girls turned to
a passionate pride in his handsome son; and the boy, frank,
honest, golden, gay, debonair, returned the old man&#8217;s affection,
drilled him in the subtleties with gentleness, and watched over
his father like a father.</p>

<p>The young fellow, with an astuteness that promised well for
the rise of his house, was spending the summer with a Magdalen
undergraduate, an old Harrow schoolfellow&mdash;a young lord whose
father was in the Cabinet; in fact, Horace, with airy cheerfulness,
was cementing friendships that might be of value to his
father in the political life which he was contemplating for himself,
and later on for his son.</p>

<p>The millionaire hungered for the lad; and, in his absence, he
poured into Betty&#8217;s ears all his hopes for him, his pride in him,
his affection for him.</p>

<p>And it was good to see that his pride in the lad&#8217;s aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ways was wholly undamped by any suspicion that the boy despised
him&mdash;whereas with his girls he felt their despisings at every
turn.</p>

<p>Betty had hoped, for his father&#8217;s sake, that the youth would
come home for a few days before his term began at Oxford; but
when he came she endured her severest trial.</p>

<p>Horace Malahide, fresh from the society of well-bred people,
at once found himself at ease with Betty. His bright wit, his
airy love of life, his frank ways, his affection and his care for his
father, his patience and his delicacy in correcting him, won the
esteem of the girl. And she, for a day or so, not knowing the
attraction of her own beauty, enjoyed his companionship.</p>

<p>She realized, all at once, that he was ignoring his sisters. She
found it impossible to withdraw herself from the position. Her
sudden avoidances of him inflamed the youth&#8217;s desire for her companionship.
He became a trial to her.</p>

<p>Then came letters sad with sighs. How the young dogs all
take to the same water!</p>

<p>She found a fragment of the poetic pinned to her dressing-table,
in which fragment was much rhyming of Modeyne with
&#8220;<i>I ween</i>,&#8221; and tributes to &#8220;<i>dainty shoulders chill, and cruel with
disdainings keen</i>,&#8221; and complaints of &#8220;<i>ignorings of worship that
any beauty who, less proud of mien, had been, must surely needs
have seen</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dictionary had been ransacked for rhymes.</p>

<p>The lad was in the euphemistic stage of poetic debauchery;
and Betty could never abide indifferent verse. He chose the
surest way to this very desert of ignorings and shoulders chill
and the like disdainings. The devil was in it for the lad all
through.</p>

<p>So the poetic bugling sounded the trump of his rejection.</p>

<p>He went up to Oxford; and for close upon three days was well-nigh
disconsolate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s admiration, most unwitting of it, did the girl a sad
disservice.</p>

<p>The unspoken verdict of their modish brother, in preferring this
girl&#8217;s society to theirs, roused the ill-will of his neglected sisters;
and the two young women, whilst their full red lips kissed Betty
good-morning as sweetly as was their wont, took to tittle-tattling
against her.</p>

<p>The tittle-tattle bred further tittle-tattle, unloosed suggestive
and insinuating tongues, and at last Dame Gossip bumped up,
giggling, against the doors of <i>The Cock and Bull</i> in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>The tavern vomited its secret.</p>

<p>The ghost of Major Modeyne arose from the dead and walked;
and was seen in Park Lane.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with one of those Emotional Crises that change the
Whole Tenor of a Man&#8217;s Political Convictions</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> millionaire was in the most hearty of good moods&mdash;could not
sit still in his office&mdash;came home and could not sit still in his home.
He tramped his house; was jocularly familiar with the servants;
slapped the housemaids on the back; gave them half-sovereigns;
twitted them about lovers; chaffed the shocked footman; dug
the solemn butler Pontefract in the waistband; punched him in
the chest and wind, the astounded servant clumsily guarding the
threatened parts; and told him crude stories.</p>

<p>He told every separate servant of his household, as he had told
every separate clerk in his offices on one pretext or other during
the morning, that he was to be the guest of honour at a big banquet
together with the Marquis of Malahide&mdash;&#8220;the head of our family,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pompey Malahide had always thanked Providence for his
own cunning, for his energy, and, to a certain extent, for his luck&mdash;or
for that small portion of good chance that remained from all
successes after the results of his own keen foresight had been deducted,
which, to put it fairly, was little enough. But whilst he
felt that he himself shared with Providence not a little of his own
credit, there was one thing which he frankly set down generously
and without reserve of smallest kind to the gods&mdash;that he had
been born with a name that was in the peerage.</p>

<p>The father of Pompey, when he had left the ancestral calling
of rat-catcher on the Lincolnshire estates of the old Marquis of
Malahide and had come up to London town to seek his fortune, had
taken the name of the man for whom he had had the keenest admiration,
whilst to his son he had given in lieu of dedication to the
saints the name of the dog which had brought him most honour at
the local tavern. And by consequence, the son of the rat-catcher,
now grown to fortune, had always felt a kinship between himself
and the living marquis, whose bluff sailor ways and jovial bearing
made him the idol of the populace.</p>

<p>Indeed, a print of the great man&#8217;s portrait was the most aggressive
decoration in the house&mdash;topped by a gilt coronet and flanked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as it was, by all the prints of the great man&#8217;s ancestors that the
art-dealers could find for him or foist upon him&mdash;to which central
figure of importance he would always refer as &#8220;the head of our
house, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night, Pompey Malahide sat at the banquet, and as he sat
he received a whispered communication from a member of the
Cabinet at his right hand that made his face to shine, gorgeous,
boisterously glorified.</p>

<p>And more&mdash;when the guests had risen, it made him commit the
mistake which sent titters through the city and laughter through
the fashionable clubs for many a day; and this he did from sheer
joyousness of heart, yet, so intoxicated was he with his magnificence
that city gossips were almost justified in setting it down to
the full body of the wine.</p>

<p>The guests being risen then, and grouping into tattling knots,
our Pompey made his way, exultant, to the group that held the
jovial figure of the sailor-marquis.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;my name is Malahide&mdash;Pompey Malahide.
My family is&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;believe, in some remote way connected
with your lordship&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the silence that fell, all eyes seeking the twinkling eyes of
the sailor-marquis, our Pompey received his wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely enough!&#8221; roared the admiral, wringing the fat fingers
of the exultant Pompey in his treacherous grip&mdash;&#8220;likely enough!&#8221;
And his lordship, being mellow with wine, and in a fine rollicking
humour, had slapped him a rousing buffet upon the shoulder so
that our Pompey coughed, and with a big jolly laugh the nobleman
blandly accepted the likelihood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&mdash;likely enough!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The old lord was a
damned rogue amongst the women!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Malahides were all hail-fellow thus.</p>

<p>The jesting answer, whilst it had tickled, had not a little shocked
some that stood near, and, perhaps not the least, the sense of
delicacy of the claimant.</p>

<p>A chill aloofness might have made the wounded man adore the
idol more. What tyrannies will we not suffer from the gods!
But to be overwhelmed in city humour had smitten our Pompey
in his most sensitive parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that night Pompey Malahide knew no sleep. And he arose
in the early morning ashamed and sorely wounded. It had been
a shabby enough blow, but he had put himself in the way of a
drunken fellow&#8217;s fisticuff....</p>

<p>Up he got as soon as it was daylight, kicked his heels out of bed,
and, having dressed, ranged restlessly about the house; and it
thus chanced that one of his daughters, Judith, early risen, came
upon him, and twitted him with looking distressed.</p>

<p>In a fit of confidence, he showed the girl the wound. And she,
seeing her opportunity, petted him, and as soon as she in decency
could turn him from his distress, told him of her discovery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Modeyne skeleton&mdash;opened the ugly cupboard and let it tumble
out.</p>

<p>And into the ears of the brooding man the hot red lips dropped
a poisonous suggestion of the girl&#8217;s seeking marriage with Horace.</p>

<p>The man was in the mood to see ghosts in every shadow. He
was too much taken up with his own affairs to smell an ugly plot
amongst his own kin.</p>

<p>He went to the library, his fast unbroken, and with a sour
mouth, and rang the bell. He told the footman who answered his
summons to send a maid to Miss Modeyne&#8217;s room and tell her he
would like to see her when she came down.</p>

<p>Betty came tripping at the summons; shut the door; and
stood a-wonder before the shamed seated man.</p>

<p>She stepped forward anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Malahide,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;I hope you are not ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>He saw that the white hand she put on the desk trembled. A
hoarse note came into her voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope nothing has happened to your son&mdash;Horace&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Miss Betty&mdash;but I have had information, through a
friend, an old friend of my family, this morning that I believe is
a lie. I hope to God&mdash;it is&mdash;a&mdash;lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty suddenly understood that she was the subject of the
interview, and silence fell upon her. She drew herself up quietly
and awaited the blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Betty, this good lady says that your father was a quite
impossible person. She says that he was a notorious drunkard.
Was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty bowed her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said simply.</p>

<p>The hope went out of the man&#8217;s eyes; he tried again, trusting
to a denial:</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that he was the subject of a coroner&#8217;s inquest, and
that his disreputable life was the talk of the town a while ago.
Was that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that he was a Papist&mdash;that you came into my house
and breathed no word of it. Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that your companionship may sully the innocence of
my girls; which is a damned lie&mdash;excuse my saying so.... But
she says that people are making comments about my girls being
seen with you.... I wish to God that were a lie too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brooding man put his face in his hands; and there was a
long silence.</p>

<p>He roused after a little while and went on again:</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that you, if you stay here, may win the regard of my
boy Horace&mdash;she says that it would be worse than Miss Sally
Ornce.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Betty thought wearily that he referred to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
allurements of some rival lady. It suddenly came to her that the
poor fellow meant <i>m√©salliance</i>.</p>

<p>The clumsy man gazed miserably out of the window:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what in God&#8217;s wonder to do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The girl bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went and shook hands with him; and quietly left the
room....</p>

<p>The two ladies, straining their ears at the door that stood
slightly ajar into the next room, were edified.</p>

<p>They opened the door a little way and peeped in.</p>

<p>They would have been extremely annoyed had they known that
Betty had caught a glimpse of them&mdash;had taken in the situation
at a flash.</p>

<p>They were surprised to hear their father sigh. When he put
his head down on the table and sobbed, they stole away.</p>

<p>Indeed, tittering over the details afterwards with friends, they
<i>declared</i>, if we may take the word of such as listen at doors, that
they were highly amused&mdash;that it was near as good as a play....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Betty, tipping the cabman for taking her trunk up to her attic,
knocked at Miss Flora Jennyns&#8217; door, entered, and, running to the
little old lady&#8217;s chair, sank on the footstool at her feet and flung
her arms about her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come home,&#8221; she said, happy to be with the old gentlewoman
again.</p>

<p>Miss Flora put out her hand and stroked the girl&#8217;s brown hair;
and she smiled through tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been very lonely,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A couple of days after Betty had gone, Mr. Pompey Malahide
sat down at his desk, a bland smile upon him, and wrote to his son:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Horace</span>,</p>

<p>The Tory Chest has, you will perhaps have guessed, received
another twenty thousand pounds from me. But one must, as a
patriot, make sacrifices for the good of the country. You will,
I feel sure, be proud to know that the Malahides&mdash;our branch of
them&mdash;are about to take rank as Baronets.</p>

<p>I regret to state, however, that there has been, at the Carlton,
a distinct aloofness of the members of the Upper House towards
me personally, since we came in with so large a majority, in so
much that I feel, on entering some of these men&#8217;s houses, as if I
were breathing air that had passed over ice.</p>

<p>On careful consideration over my political ideals, I have lately
come to the conclusion (and I have aristocratic precedents for
changing my political opinions), that, on receiving my baronetcy,
I shall take the first dramatic and telling opportunity to embarrass
the Government and go over to the other side of the House.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">Your affectionate father,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Pompey Malahide</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>To which Horace replied by return:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear old Father</span>,</p>

<p>I wish you would not split your verbs so recklessly.</p>

<p>To resist the condescension of the new aristocracy in the way
you suggest would be, for you, utterly disastrous, both as a matter
of good taste and as a dramatic effect&mdash;to say nothing of a bid for
social distinction.</p>

<p>The test of good manners in the highly placed is the capacity
for the exercise of extreme insolence without offence to the estimation
of the class. What would be a vulgarity in you or me is a
splendid airiness in the Prime Minister. Your fine gentleman
may seduce a lady&#8217;s maid, but must not be seen to cheat at cards.
The tears of a seduced woman set the tables of the new nobility
a-titter; but to win a guinea by oversharp practice with trumps
is to discover the moth amongst the ermine on the cloak of honour.
Your courtier&#8217;s manners are but gaudy beads strung on a thread
of menial subtleties. You have not the practice, my dear father;
and would only blunder upon the indecencies.</p>

<p>The new aristocracy demands our patience&mdash;it takes three
hundred years of usage before a family becomes quite used to its
own nobility; by that time it is usually bankrupt.</p>

<p>It is only possible for a man of birth and unassailable breeding
to become a radical without appearing ridiculous.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which, to some extent, discloses the Incident of the Sentimental
Tea-cups</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anthony,</span> forestalling the youngster&#8217;s fretting for the girl&#8217;s companionship,
decided to send him up to Oxford at once; but with
all haste it was some months before he could go, and the lad,
though he stuck manfully to his heavy work with the tutor,
became languid and listless and vague. He fretted silently, and
was filled with an ugly distrust of those about him. It had brought
to him a sudden revelation of the need to stand alone&mdash;a revelation
that is a part of the heritage of life to all at emergence from
youth, but comes to some roughly enough.</p>

<p>He grimly forbore from asking questions, and fell away from
his frank boyish friendship with his own people&mdash;the cheery, intimate,
and open good-fellowship with his father and his mother
gave way to a strange aloofness, and there developed in its place
a self-reliance and a haughty desire to try the wings of his own
judgment that bred much foolishness, as well as strength. His
mother sadly put down the lad&#8217;s cubbishness to the coming of
manhood, and accepted much of the brusqueness as being a part
of the inevitable period of cubhood when the whelp is for trying
its strength and for leaving the litter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s arrival at Oxford started the man&#8217;s shadow in him to
life. He moved towards the shadow eagerly, and grasped at the
reality which cast it. Flung suddenly into a sea of youth of his
own age, he was at grips with his own strength at once&mdash;tried it,
as by instinct, against the wills of the youths about him, all of
whom, also come abroad out of their homes, were essaying their
strength and affections and cunning upon each other, straining
the cords wilfully to the breaking pitch both of the affections and
of the hostilities.</p>

<p>It was the best thing that could have happened to the young
blood; the strain of the life kept him from the fret of the injustice
that had been put upon him, and drew his mind for awhile from
brooding on the blackness of the empty place where his natural
mate had until now moved in dainty harmony with his existence.</p>

<p>He was in a new world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>He suddenly found, to his surprise, that there was that which
gave him position amongst the undergraduates which had been
completely ignored amongst the intellectual Bohemians. These
others had taken him on his merits&mdash;he was now taken on the
merit of his family. He found that the important thing was not
as to what he was, but as to what his father was. He was given
his place and his measure of pleasantnesses largely in the degree of
his social position. He awoke to the fact that he had a social
position&mdash;a rung on a long ladder, reaching up to dignity and the
smiles of the dignified others.</p>

<p>The atmosphere here was wholly different. It was less literary,
more academic; less intellectual, more scholastic; less original,
more conventional; less artistic, more grammatic&mdash;life, literature,
art, every human activity was judged, not by the standard
of the emotions, but by the restrictions of the common law, by
precedents. The very pleasures were built upon tradition; he
could not amuse himself as he willed without being looked upon
askance. And all this atmosphere, odd to say, was not created
by the professors, but by the youths of his own age, who were
coming up from the great public schools.</p>

<p>The young fellow began at once to win the friendship of such
of the youngsters as had his own frank habits and ways; and it
was at this phase that was born his lifelong friendship with young
Horace Malahide.</p>

<p>Everything in the relation of his fellows to him was done
through an atmosphere. His first term threw him into nodding
acquaintance with two or three young peers of his own year, and
with youngsters who were the sons of county magnates&mdash;several
of them indeed county magnates themselves. These young
fellows he found to be friendly and genial to a certain point, when
suddenly they stepped into another atmosphere from which he
was subtly excluded. It was done by the most delicate of tricks,
and was chiefly made apparent by their manner towards another
in their own atmosphere as in comparison with their manner
towards him. He noticed the youngsters who had been school-friends
at the great public schools, now drifted apart, shifted their
affection, stepped quietly away from their old association and
habits, and were swallowed each into a well-defined set....</p>

<p>When, however, Noll returned to Oxford for his second term
he found himself in a new atmosphere. One of the young peers
walked into his rooms as an intimate friend&mdash;accosted him with
the heartiness that showed him he had passed into the set&mdash;he
was the same youth&mdash;the other was the same youth&mdash;something
had chanced, and changed the attitude.</p>

<p>Noll bent his big brows upon it, resenting it as an impertinence.
But the others were equally urbane, friendly&mdash;yet not a word
passed&mdash;there was nothing to make the excuse for a resentment.</p>

<p>He only knew some while afterwards that Lord Wyntwarde
had asked the youth, meeting him in the hunting-field, if a young
cousin of his, one Noll Baddlesmere, were not up at Magdalen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
him. The youth had passed the word quite subtly. Gentlemen
should never do vulgar things vulgarly.</p>

<p>Noll thenceforth moved in <i>the</i> set, and its allied sets. He
breathed <i>the</i> atmosphere. But being an airy person, of kindly and
genial nature, he was not by way of examining into motives, nor
of very strictly carrying out the subtle hints of the others in the
Atmosphere; thus it came about that he dove-tailed several
cliques that would otherwise have practised a more rigid exclusiveness
towards each other.</p>

<p>And he carried with him, into the most exclusive groups of
young nobles, amongst whom he was soon well-liked, his genial
friend Horace Malahide....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll&#8217;s career at Oxford was a short one.</p>

<p>He nearly got through his first year.</p>

<p>A certain superficial cleverness laid the gin for the lad&#8217;s fall.</p>

<p>His taste in literary expression had been cultivated to a brilliancy
beyond his years by association with the witty Bohemians,
and by the reading of good work; it had, above all, been developed
by the artistic guidance of Eustace Lovegood. The lad therefore
now found it difficult to wade through the cheap academic
facetiousness and thin style of the literary ventures that exploited
in dullard local reviews the an√¶mic wit which passed for fiery
originality amongst the undergraduates, and mistook itself for a
revolutionary upheaval in their puerile and stupid magazines.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should write, with an almost uncanny
facility, a sketch, daring, skilful, and precocious enough to stand
out amidst this dead level of the commonplace. He at once made
a mark which exaggerated his powers, judged only by comparison
with much that was colourless and bloodless and vapid and weak.</p>

<p>As a sure result, having caught the eye of the others, and hearing
himself quoted, he wrote again; and by the greatest misfortune
and not in the least realizing that he was stirring the most offensive
of mud in the otherwise healthy stream of the life of the schools,
he wrote a satiric sketch on the Greek friendship of two notorious
youths, that sent spluttering laughter through the halls and
common-rooms, and made the position of the two young nobles
at the university wholly untenable. The laughter that greeted
<i>The Eton Marriage</i> was not run down when Horace Malahide
followed with a satiric newspaper report of the divorce of the two
youths, in which dons were solemnly trotted out as chaperons and
society beauties and lawyers and officers of the court; whilst a
ridiculous series of questions and answers, in examination and cross
examination, aired the foibles and cranks and eccentricities and
confirmed waggeries of the more pronounced local celebrities.</p>

<p>Written as a mere whimsical squib on the seemingly ill-assorted
friendship of a burly athletic youth for a dandified effeminate
lordling of almost womanly beauty and √¶sthetic pretensions, the
squib burst and discovered an awful and ugly state of affairs. To
none did it bring more startling illumination than to the makers
of the squib.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Both Noll and Horace were staggered at the scandals their
somewhat tasteless fooling disclosed. There was much hushing
up to be done. The two young nobles would soon be assisting to
govern the country; and they must be saved&mdash;thus the tradition
worked. They found life at the university wholly impossible,
and retired to the House of Lords&mdash;to their peers, so runs the
quaint phrase.</p>

<p>Noll and Horace hammered out the business, and came to the
conclusion that a certain lack of good-taste on their own part had
cost their beloved university a very ugly blow; they withdrew
their names at the hint of the solemn faces of their masters and
superiors who ruled over them, and gave their farewell reception.</p>

<p>They purged their contempt in tea.</p>

<p>Noll, in a fit of retrenchment, said it must be tea; having discovered
that he had run through his whole three years&#8217; allowances.
Horace, always shy of displaying his wealth, on the theory that
it was against good taste in the newly enriched, supported the
decision for economy and tea&mdash;and ordered the most exquisite
Limoges service for the solemnities.</p>

<p>In far London, Bartholomew Doome, scenting aroma of naughtiness
in the air, hastened down to Horace and Oxford for the
day, fearing to be out of the scandal, and added his Byronic
gloom and atmosphere of tragic wickedness to the smoke-filled
rooms. He made a profound impression and many friends;
indeed, it may be admitted without exaggerating his success that
he was betrayed into no slightest hint of a decent emotion.</p>

<p>The tea being drunk, and the kindly farewells taken, the roomful
of youths solemnly stood up, and Noll and Horace as solemnly
broke their cups that none should again drink from them or sully
the memory of the glorious days they had all spent together. The
pieces were flung into the street.</p>

<p>The others, each taking a cup and saucer with them, in memory
of their friendship, shook hands and filed slowly out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As youth broke sentimental tea-cups, the Oxford tradesman
who owned the debt for them, sitting in his little counting-house,
was reading a letter from a Hebrew friend in the offices of The
Tradesmen&#8217;s Defence League in London.</p>

<p>This letter, after various facetious references to the tradesman&#8217;s
family, proceeds to display the very shrewdest knowledge
of the details that made up Noll&#8217;s family history&mdash;his connections,
his prospects&mdash;not wholly unmixed with some sly wit and comical
allusions. The writer thinks that Noll may be a coming man, he
has done so badly at Oxford; considers that he is not devoid of
generous and honourable instincts; is of opinion that any debt
he may contract will eventually be paid; and ends with the
personal note as thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I like a man as can slop the gilders about a bit, myself. And
as for academic honours, why, you and me was neither of us strong

on the crop.</p>

<p>I hold out my homely fist.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Reuben McCubbie.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;This here Oliver Baddlesmere ain&#8217;t so far off the peerage

what even you or me is.</p>

<p>They do say, too, that the cub has found a girl. Early
marriage, Samuel, gives hostages against the most gentlemanly
blackguardism.</p>

<p>But I garrule.</p>

<p>Again I hold out the aforesaid fist.</p>

<p>Be good.</p>

<p>This letter seems to be all about money. I sometimes think
I&#8217;m a damned Jew.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, be good.</p>

increment!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein we are bewildered by the Cooings of Chivalry</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty,</span> flung back again upon her own resources, realized that,
for a woman, there were two careers elaborately ordered by the
deliberate plan of the world&mdash;marriage or vice. For the rest,
to woman had been flung the slave-callings, the menial ends of
professions, the ill-paid jobs of the commerce of life. This
shabby deed of gift was leprously covered by an hypocrisy of
Chivalry&mdash;which in practice largely worked out as the courting,
when it did not interfere with other pleasures, of the young and
comely women; the seizing and exploiting of the fortunes of
the middle-aged; and the neglect of the old and the unprepossessing.</p>

<p>For a while Betty was at her wits&#8217; end to know how to earn
the wage of decency, when she again decided to apply to Netherby
and ask him to get her some literary hack-work; and Netherby,
entrusting her with a review or two of books, was delighted with
the result, as was also his editor. Betty felt thankful to be doing
work that did not force upon her the wading in personal humiliations;
and this her new means of breadwinning, small though it
was, helped in its very exercise to give her facility in the craftsmanship
of her art&mdash;her hand thereby increased its cunning, and
literary expression became a confirmed habit. She soon passed
from the stage of seeking a style&mdash;the careful and laborious picking
out of the notes from the music of the instrument and the
placing them in telling harmonies, to the mastery of the whole
range and gamut of the instrument, when the music came resonant
and vivid in answer to the mood of her desire.</p>

<p>And she practised also the inevitable typewriter, taking bouts
of work upon occasion, to win a little bread or to help Julia to the
winning. Click-click-click went the deft fingers, spelling out into
print the ill-shaped grammar of the city.</p>

<p>She saw much of Julia in these days; and to Julia she brought
incalculable good&mdash;her cheerfulness and the gaiety and tenderness
of her sweet young womanhood gave to the narrow-shouldered
half-starved city girl a wholesome companionship that filled out
her thin life and enlarged her cockney vision. Julia inhaled the
atmosphere of good-breeding and of uncomplaining cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
courage which was Betty&#8217;s very breath; and she grew to infinite
riches by sharing the golden gifts that Betty had to give
her.</p>

<p>Slave-castes mistake womanishness for womanliness. A true
woman is neither an idiot nor a man.</p>

<p>The girl Julia had lived her girlhood receptively feminine&mdash;courageous
in her defensive virtues. She was now roused to the
positive virtues of womanhood.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which touches upon the Pains of Enjoying the Glow of Self-Abasement
whilst Maintaining a Position of Dignity</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Noll and Horace stood on the platform of the railway-station
at Oxford, waiting for the London express to take them to town,
Horace Malahide began to feel some discomfort about the brooding
mood of the other&mdash;for the first time he was distressed with
the question whether they ought not to have remained at Oxford.
He knew that Noll had but narrow means. Guessing that Noll
was in some embarrassment as to how to explain his sudden
return to his people, he, to divert him from worrying, called his
wandering attention to a newspaper criticism upon a book which
had just come out and was creating considerable stir in the
literary world.</p>

<p>Horace, holding up the newspaper criticism, put his finger upon
the name of Caroline Baddlesmere. Noll roused and read the
notice. The writer, Anthony Bickersteth, was proclaimed as
the founder of a new school&mdash;a new star had risen above the dead
level of the commonplace literature of the day&mdash;and all of the
review that was not violent praise of this Anthony Bickersteth
was the cover for a bitter and sneering screed against the work of
Caroline Baddlesmere, who, so it bluntly averred, had gone well-nigh
to destroying English as an artistic language. The writer&#8217;s
judgment would have been of more weight, perhaps, had his
English been of more value; but even his ill-balanced phrasing,
his academic eyes, his dullard&#8217;s palate, and his faulty ear, could
not altogether damn the object of his adoration; and Noll,
struck by the beauty of phrasing in some of the quoted passages,
bought a copy of the book at the station stall as the train came
clanking in. He ran through its pages on his journey to town....</p>

<p>As they rattled through the outskirts of London, Horace, who
had been watching the other&#8217;s face, asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it any good, Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll shut up the book, and stretched himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;but I think the fellow would have
shown better taste not to hit at my mother in the Preface.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>Horace broke it:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;Noll, old boy,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;shall I drive you home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going home, thanks,&#8221; said Noll&mdash;and he added,
seeing surprise in the eyes of the other: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to face old
Lord Wyntwarde first&mdash;he&#8217;s a sort of relation of mine&mdash;and has
been paying for my being at Oxford.... My own people are
very badly off.... I don&#8217;t think I ought to let the unpleasantness
of the interview fall upon my people. And I&#8217;m funking
it....&#8221; And he added grimly, after a while: &#8220;I understand
why men sometimes get drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;ll blow over all right.... Look here,
Noll; you&#8217;d better come to my people to-day, stay over the
night, and go on to-morrow to the eating of dirt....&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came that Noll spent his first evening in the Malahide
household. And the girls both vowed the next day to their
separate bosom friends that they &#8220;had met their fate.&#8221; It
leaked out during the confidences of each that Horace had discovered
to them that the youth was kinsman to a certain Lord
Wyntwarde....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hot-headed old lord stood a-straddle before his fireplace,
and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>How the blood of this house repeated itself!</p>

<p>Here was this young fellow pacing up and down the room as
though he were laying down the terms of a surrender.</p>

<p>By the dogs, a handsome young fellow! Like his mother&mdash;with
a trick or two of the father in him.</p>

<p>He himself had thus prowled this room in like disgrace with the
lord of the house years ago. What a while ago!... This lad&#8217;s
father also&mdash;now this one! By the book, wonderful!</p>

<p>The fact was that the old lord&#8217;s wilful admiration followed this
proud lad with a sense of affection that was strange to him&mdash;the
youth appealed to him more than did the more elaborate father.
He had more of the beauty of the old house about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, my lad,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been listening over-well to
what you have been saying&mdash;I&#8217;ve been thinking hard that you
ought to have been my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll stopped in his walk, stopped in his talk&mdash;hesitated.</p>

<p>He uttered an embarrassed laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been apologizing, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221; growled Wyntwarde. &#8220;That is a relief to me&mdash;I
thought you were ordering <i>me</i> to apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll shrugged his shoulders, and took to his pacing of the room
again, silenced.</p>

<p>The old lord watched him grimly, saying nothing.</p>

<p>Noll suddenly halted, swung round, and faced him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, sir,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I ought to have rid you of my
company before this. But I felt bound to make you what poor
reparation I could for all your goodness to me. I did not write,
because&mdash;a personal apology is always far more punishment to
me than the written word. This has been a punishing task to me&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
have dreaded it&mdash;loathed it. And yet, I fear, it has seemed
but a lame and sorry reparation to you.... I will not fret you
any longer. I am done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wyntwarde laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho, Noll&mdash;so you are run dry at last!... Now I can get
a word in edgeways; and I, too, may cackle, though it lack your
literary finish.... You see, as we are in the confessional, I may
say I have been a bit of a dog in my day. And, by Beelzebub!
the gout hasn&#8217;t altogether driven the last spark out of me
yet.... The tongues still wag about me, I have no smallest
doubt.... It isn&#8217;t for me to preach you a sermon on your tom-follies,
for they are infernally like my own. By God, you are no
curate, there&#8217;s that much against you in heaven. Still, I will tell
you bluntly, I have only had one fear for you&mdash;and that is the
dandified schoolmaster that is in the heart of your father. The
Ffolliotts never had any of the damned studious habits&mdash;we
have always been sportsmen and gentlemen. And, by my soul,
I believe you are bitten by the self-same dog.... It&#8217;s this
literary business that makes me anxious about you; but a lampoon
and a sharp tongue we all of us had the knack of using&mdash;<i>that</i>
don&#8217;t go with long hair and inky fingers and spectacles nor
a milkman&#8217;s seat on a horse. By God, you may lampoon the
Lord Chancellor, for all <i>I</i> care&mdash;I never go to the House of Lords
except to keep the damned idiot in his place. Lords Chancellor
nowadays seem to think the Upper House is a confounded dames&#8217;
school. Damn all Lords Chancellor, say I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;damn all Lords Chancellor!&#8221; said Noll drily.</p>

<p>Wyntwarde laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;we wander.... Now, look you here, Noll&mdash;this
house is free to you as long as you keep your fingers from
ink-stains and your lips from preaching&mdash;the stables are not
empty of horses. And, what&#8217;s more, I still hold to my bond.
The &#8217;Varsity is over&mdash;down goes three hundred a year. It
would be damned bad morals to give you that again. But you
shall have a couple of hundred a year as long as rumour speaks
well of you; but the day you throw up the society of gentlemen
and mix with the inky-fingered gentry, I will not only cancel
you from my will, but, by the dogs, I stop even the allowance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not accept benefits under threat, sir,&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>Wyntwarde stopped, scowled&mdash;burst into a laugh, and passed
the matter by:</p>

<p>&#8220;I would make it more,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I suspect the ink-pot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have a mind to spill ink I will spill it,&#8221; said the youth
hotly.</p>

<p>The old lord chuckled:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are your father&#8217;s son, my boy, on occasion,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing to attract you here just now; but you
had better come down for the hunting next winter, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll made a step towards him&mdash;hesitated&mdash;his mouth hardened:</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&#8220;I cannot stay in a house, sir, which my mother has struck off
her visiting list,&#8221; he said sullenly.</p>

<p>The old lord laughed loudly and long:</p>

<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you are a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the youth and gripped him by the shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Noll&mdash;it can&#8217;t be. Your mother would never stand the
new aristocracy&mdash;it&#8217;s so damned like the old profligacy&mdash;without
the breeding.... Good-bye, my boy; and damn all ink-stains,
say I!&#8221;...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Noll reached London he decided to go and see his mother,
and make her acquainted with his doings and his intentions. He
had an uneasy feeling that he had unjustly neglected her of late.</p>

<p>He was glad to find, when he arrived, that his father was away
from home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As his mother stood there in her attic, listening to him, Noll
was filled with a glow of pride in her gentle womanly dignity and
her resourceful and uncomplaining good breeding.</p>

<p>The place had an air that made the word &#8220;attic&#8221; classical....</p>

<p>Noll, somewhat embarrassed as to how to broach the subject,
had begun by denouncing the preface to the new book which held
a sneer at his mother; and she had laughed it quietly by. Then
Noll had told her of the reviews; and ended by giving her something
of a lesson in the art of letters! He himself thought very
well of this new book&mdash;and gave his mother more than one good
hint from Anthony Bickersteth.</p>

<p>Caroline turned to the little mirror over the mantel, as the
youth finished speaking, to hide a little dry smile that played
about her mouth. She touched her hair with handsome white
hands. It was a trick she had.</p>

<p>Noll saw the movement; caught the reflected smile in the
mirror; and faltered.</p>

<p>It came to him that he had been just a trifle patronizing to
his mother about this new book by Anthony Bickersteth&mdash;a little
condescending about her powers. He was chilled with a sudden
uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Noll?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Noll went to the attic window and looked out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I feel ashamed of these doles from Wyntwarde&mdash;I
must win a career with the pen, and be rid of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are taking to the hardest trade in the world, Noll&mdash;and
all the harder because it looks the easiest. Still, I am wholly
with you in the sentiment. I should be sorry indeed to see you
dependent on Wyntwarde. And I am glad to have you at home&mdash;I
was looking at your child toys last night, and&mdash;I&mdash;felt&mdash;almost&mdash;as
if&mdash;you were dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll was silent for awhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I find it rather hard to say what I came to say, mother, after
that,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;it is not your fault or mine that childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
must pass, with all its delight&mdash;we might as well try to hold
the hand of death.... Say what you came to say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother&mdash;I have found a couple of rooms in New Inn,
that will just hold me; and, without Wyntwarde&#8217;s help, I ought
to be able to keep myself and get into the way of winning my own
bread in a very few months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline Baddlesmere sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Noll&mdash;it is perhaps better that you should make your
own life&mdash;and in your own way. It is one of the agonies of
motherhood that the brood must leave the nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mother&mdash;it is not that.... I have to pass a room on
the stairs that&mdash;in the passing&mdash;makes my heart ache&mdash;takes
the man out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His lip trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Noll; I understand. I have seen you fret at many
things here&mdash;as I myself have sometimes fretted at them....
I am able, too, to help you a little now&mdash;I have had a little windfall&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll left the window and went to his mother. He put his hands
on her shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mother. I will have none of it. You ought not to be
living in an attic&mdash;and I am not going to help to keep you there.
It is one of the prospects that will make me work&mdash;that I should
see you in your proper position. Not that, God knows, this
attic has ever given me a moment&#8217;s shame; for you have made
it a palace to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caroline kissed his handsome face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;you are something of a man.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which is Uneasy with the Restlessness of Youth</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Pompey Malahide</span> came into his baronetcy on a fine
summer&#8217;s day; and Noll spent the resulting week of high festivities
with Horace and the family, and there strengthened his
friendship with Bartholomew Doome, whose unsnobbish affection
and care of the rough merchant won Noll&#8217;s regard even more
than his grim humour.</p>

<p>Horace, his father baroneted and the feasting done, decided
to go to Paris for a change&mdash;&#8220;to get the odour of cooked bullocks
from his nostrils.&#8221; Noll saw him off at the railway-station;
saw his man Jonkin, of the ducal manner, tuck him up in his
railway-carriage; watched the train slide out of the station&mdash;and
sighed to lose the light-hearted companionship of the sunny
youth.</p>

<p>The departing of a comrade sends a cloud across the bluest sky.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll, with the confidence of youth, decided to be a literary
celebrity.</p>

<p>He felt that it would be a brilliant and fascinating position to
hold; and it required no capital. It was not to be bought.
There was an air about it.</p>

<p>But the having his own study and separate establishment did
not raise the masterpiece out of the deeps&mdash;nor did the world
thrill at his originality so readily as he had hoped. He did much
chewing of the quill.</p>

<p>Being young, he wrote for art&#8217;s sake; and it was the beginning
of several affectations in which he half believed.</p>

<p>His solitary hours of work, and of brooding upon work, were
fretted with other and more overwhelming dreams. The rustle
of women&#8217;s petticoats began to trouble him as he wrote. In the
faces that passed him in the street he saw beckoning eyes under
many a pretty bonnet. And the writing, dragging already for
want of life and substance, now further dragged, interrupted by
the frills and figures of women.</p>

<p>All nature&#8217;s urging of the adolescent to part from the parent
brood was calling upon him to pair; and the mystic fascination
of the fragrance of women was enhanced by the restlessness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dawning manhood that vexes the lustiness of youth with the
blatant trumpet-call to action, the fret to be up and about and
doing.</p>

<p>The dainty place that Betty had held by his side was empty.
And the gentle companionship of the girl that had filled the lad&#8217;s
life gave way to a vague hunger for affection.</p>

<p>To him in his grey loneliness came, as fairy to brooding Cinderella,
lighting the sordid gloom of his toil, fitful flashes of the
girl&#8217;s face in his day-dreams. Betty still held vague possession
of his affections. But youth is not content to clutch at thin air.</p>

<p>Noll cudgelled his wits at the desk of his lonely room, in vain.</p>

<p>The masterpiece would not come.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then the youth decided that he was making a mistake&mdash;he was
keeping himself too much to himself. He would go deep into
the literary world. He was convinced that a literary man can do
nothing unless he be in the Literary Swim.</p>

<p>A letter from Horace was his confirmation. Horace was fascinated
by the student-life of Paris&mdash;its free-handed comradeship,
its gaiety, its good-fellowship in all things, its frank acceptance
of nature, its rebellion against the rigid conventions, its
freedom from cant, its glory in the joy of life. He had decided
to give up his life of wealth at home for a few years, to be a poor
student in Paris for awhile, to put aside the boredoms of the
pampered rich, and, like the strenuous man, to live life largely.</p>

<p>He thought, on the whole, he would keep his valet on&mdash;but
Jonkin was to dress like himself, as a student, corduroy trousers,
black coat, slouch hat and all. There was to be no tomfoolery
in it&mdash;he was going to be the poor student right through. And
the girls of the Latin quarter, heavens! he kissed his hand to
them....</p>

<p>Within a month, Noll was elected to a literary club&mdash;one of
those places where men turn in to wash their hands on the
way to the <i>Athen√¶um</i>.</p>

<p>At the first entry into this club, the youth felt that he was
come amongst the very wits. But the minor critic Fosse fussed
about him, and took the earliest confidential opportunity to
whisper to him with wink and nod that it was owing to <i>his</i> interest
in him that Noll had been elected over the heads of men who had
been waiting for years at the portals in vain. The thrill trickled
out of the glamour of his election a little as each of several others
confided to Noll that it was owing to <i>his</i> exertions and <i>his</i> following
that his election had been so speedily secured&mdash;and that
everyone else in the gathering was but mediocre and painstaking.
His conceit in his honours slowly leaked away.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre, though kind,
at once roused uneasiness and soul-searchings in the youth. He
pointed out that the man of genius was the type of his time, the
outward and visible as much as the inward and spiritual; that
in our age the face of genius wore a moustache&mdash;Bismarck and
Rhodes and Whistler all wore the moustache.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>Quogge Myre himself wore a moustache....</p>

<p>As the glamour of initiation wore off, the youth was oppressed
with the barrenness of the land&mdash;the petty jealousies, the tittle-tattle,
the spites, the little treacheries.</p>

<p>He came to have an unpleasant and mean desire to sit the others
out always&mdash;he knew that the moment the door closed upon him
they tore his weaknesses to pieces, and garbled his motives.</p>

<p>And still the masterpiece did not come....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme, lunching with him at the club, ended by
walking back with him to his rooms; and, out of the earshot of
the precious company, he warned the youth not to fling his fresh
ideas to these people if he would weave them into his own art.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the jackals of the arts, Noll,&#8221; said he grimly&mdash;&#8220;they
filch the ideas of other men&mdash;they follow hot-foot on the
latest success, turning out indifferent copies of the master-wits&mdash;they
will suck your brains, vampire-like. These are they who,
when a genius appears, cannot lift their eyes to his magnificence,
to the beauty of his imagination, can but seek out the sources of
his inspiration and laboriously accuse him of the footsteps in
which he had trod. Be rid of the crew. Or, keep your quaint
conceits for your workshop. Give them but the chips....
You gave those fellows this very day the scheme for a large work
of art&mdash;they have not the brains to see the potentialities that lie
latent in an idea&mdash;so some fellow of them will make a catchy
magazine essay of it&mdash;catch the newness of it and exploit it.
They are as vulgar thieves as though they stole your pence....
They are no help to you&mdash;I have done my best work even
in my small way, as many a really big man has done his, in the
back room of a dingy house, looking out upon a brick wall. What
is in you is in you&mdash;you can benefit nothing from these others....
If you have companions, have splendid companions&mdash;the
big rich-souled man. Friendship is the top of ambition. These
others will steal your very tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the humorist with his arm in Noll&#8217;s, affectionately; and
left Noll brooding at the threshold of his simple home....</p>

<p>Netherby spoke prophecy.</p>

<p>A month or two later, an article in a leading review, signed
by Mr. Fosse, won some notice by its youthful daring, indiscretion,
and invention&mdash;Noll sighed to see his own wits could be
so shabbily clothed.</p>

<p>Noll took up the magazine by veriest chance at the club.</p>

<p>He read the sorry thing, and flung it upon the table; and, as
he flung it down, Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre entered
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Aubrey,&#8221; cried he to the languid poet, with loud voice
that was ever pitched to carry his carefully wrought spontaneities
to the listening world: &#8220;I am sorry to be late, but, for pleasant
hours with Lady Persimmon, I could almost be content to appear
ill-bred. She moves me&mdash;so few women move me.&#8221; He sat
down beside the poet, and slapped the poetic leg giddily: &#8220;For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a handsome woman one must neglect even a poet, eh? Ha-ha!
even the handsomest and the chastest of them all love their
squeeze. Not that I&mdash;you know&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh!&#8221; muttered Aubrey, who had been vainly attempting
to check the flow of Myre&#8217;s conceit&mdash;&#8220;Baddlesmere, over there,
is her cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myre turned a dirty putty colour.</p>

<p>Noll got up from his chair and walked out of the club....</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome rose languidly from a lounge:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a happy thing for your pink and white complexion,
Myre, that Noll Baddlesmere has been too absent-minded to
overhear your yawing. I do not think I have ever seen you
glitter more consummately caddish. Besides which, you lied.
But that&#8217;s a detail. To lie to save a woman&#8217;s honour has an air&mdash;to
lie against her is to be banal. It has been done before&mdash;and
so often.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strolled towards the door.</p>

<p>Myre said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a happy thing for some people that the duel is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bartholomew Doome laughed&mdash;went out laughing&mdash;laughed
the length of Piccadilly....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An urgent demand from the Secretary, asking for his subscription,
Noll sent on to Mr. Fosse, with a waggish note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Fosse</span>,</p>

<p>I know from your own lips that I owe my election to the
club to your kind offices; and I should be sorry indeed to think
that my failure to pay my subscription may cast a slur upon you
as my sponsor. I find that the sum that you borrowed from me
when you won your success in <i>The Discriminator</i> fully covers my
subscription, and yields you a handsome profit, and I would beg
that you take advantage of the admirable opportunity of paying
your debt to me by paying my debt to the club; you will increase
my indebtedness to you by withdrawing my name from the books.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">Yours, not wholly without admiration,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Noll Baddlesmere</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Fosse, odd to say, paid the subscription.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>


<p>When Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre called at Lady
Persimmon&#8217;s the next day he was told that her ladyship was not
at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said my pushful gentleman&mdash;&#8220;I have just seen visitors
go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The footman put himself across the doorway, barring entrance:
&#8220;You are Mr. Myre, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her ladyship has given instructions that she is never at home
to persons of the name of Myre. Go away.&#8221; He slammed the
door in the great man&#8217;s face.</p>

and for awhile to Paris and live amongst the clouds&mdash;puts
it in terms of poetry and of romance and of pounds shillings and

word for the artistic home? And why? Because <i>he discovered
the Man</i> who could tell him what was good furnishment.
He himself at inmost heart prefers the cuckoo-clock.... And
the girls too, thou canst widen their view, enlarge the outlook of
their narrow Putney eyes; your good-fellowship must of a certainty
mitigate their cockney ambitions. They write to me of
&#8216;cutting&#8217; people&mdash;&#8216;giving the cold shoulder&#8217; to old friends&mdash;they
are bitten with all the smart vulgarities, for all the world like
<i>d√©class√©</i> duchesses and such as are not of assured position. Get
thee to my father&#8217;s house, Noll&mdash;and bear with the overplus of
marble, the gaudy boastfulness of the too ornate enrichments.
There&#8217;s a big heart at the back of it all, and it loves thee.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I never suspected Jonkin of being a prude. He makes
me feel thrillingly immoral&mdash;like a school-girl reading her first
classic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Noll arrived at the Malahides in the afternoon, Sir
Pompey was away from home; but the ladies of the house greeted
him gladly.</p>

<p>He had not been long with the two young women before he was
overwhelmed with the embarrassment of their frank admiration.</p>

<p>The elder girl caused him no little uneasiness by her attitude
towards him; which the buxom Miss Mary further increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
very soon and most openly expressing her design to find solace in
the society of a youth from the city who was to escort her to some
shopping, adding boldly that the figure of two had in it more likely
elements of good company than the awkward wriggle called three;
and, with a suggestive laugh, she swaggered out of the room.</p>

<p>Noll was never wholly at home amongst the crudities; but he
shook off embarrassment, and made an effort to entertain the
comely Judith.</p>

<p>But ordinary converse died a natural death&mdash;Judith Malahide
was in no mood for words. She held the handsome young fellow
with her handsome eyes; she was unwontedly quiet, and, for
marvellous and becoming change, her bearing was restrained with
the compelling dignity of passion.</p>

<p>She came and stood by him, and Noll realized, with a catch of
the breath, that he was being drawn into the whirl of a reckless
young woman&#8217;s inordinate desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you been so long away, Noll?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Noll in a careless moment answered lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;How was I to know that you thought it long, Miss Judith?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s mood took flame:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are things a man knows without the telling,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I would not give a sigh for a man who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and gazed out of the window; and added with
lowered voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better not say what I was going to say; but&mdash;your lips
provoke me&mdash;to&mdash;say things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll watched her for awhile&mdash;the exquisite skin, the undisciplined
full red mouth, the handsome head. He found a strange
pleasure in the nearness of her splendid beauty.</p>

<p>She turned to him suddenly; caught the lingering admiration
in his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know exactly what you were thinking,&#8221; she
said, commandingly; &#8220;do you think you dare tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I <i>dare</i>,&#8221; he said lightly; and added seriously: &#8220;But
I would rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering whether a beautiful woman&#8217;s beauty is as
much pleasure to herself as it is to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221; She finished the broken enigma for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;To those who look upon it,&#8221; he evaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was the woman, Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to be frank, I would rather not say&mdash;it would sound
rather fulsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, and reddened:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think most people, men and women, think they are good-looking&mdash;I
think handsome people have pleasure in their good
looks.... <i>I</i> have.... But it does not bring me the glow
that looking at you gives me.&#8221; She put her hand upon her
bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Judith!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more wonders to unravel?&#8221; she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I think we had better not wonder too deeply.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are to be wise, eh?&#8221; She came close to him: &#8220;But
you have not told me how <i>you</i> are moved by a woman&#8217;s face&mdash;so
how can I tell you&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Judith, I am afraid we are playing with fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned, frowning out of the window:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These things are made of fire&mdash;they
are beyond speech.&#8221; She turned and came very close to
him: &#8220;But,&#8221; she added hoarsely, &#8220;your lips could tell my lips&mdash;without&mdash;all
this prattle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her warm hand upon his sleeve:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She turned swiftly to the window.</p>

<p>A servant entered the room; and the girl, standing still,
steadied herself with sudden self-command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said at last&mdash;&#8220;you have not seen the new white
boudoir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll roused, seizing an excuse to leave:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be going,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But she would have no denial; and led him upstairs to an exquisitely
decorated white room, the beauty of which at once
revealed the artistic taste of Bartholomew Doome.</p>

<p>Noll saw, as the door closed upon him, that he was in the girl&#8217;s
boudoir.</p>

<p>She came to him, put her arms about his neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not kiss me, Noll,&#8221; she complained passionately.</p>

<p>Noll unlocked her arms:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said he, and walked to the window.</p>

<p>She came and nestled against his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll, I can&#8217;t live this nun&#8217;s life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He put her gently from him:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is madness,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;utter madness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode to the door&mdash;stopped half way:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>She followed the gaze of his eyes to the white mantel:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Noll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the picture of the girl&mdash;to whom I&mdash;am&mdash;betrothed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She roused, and stepping, catlike, to the mantel, took down the
little portrait of Betty and flung it upon the white marble hearth.
The glass smashed, flying into a hundred tinkling pieces.</p>

<p>Noll watched her coldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Betty Modeyne?&#8221; he demanded roughly.</p>

<p>The girl faltered, uttered a moan, and leaning her handsome
head on the white hand that clutched the mantel, gazed down
upon the shattered thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Betty Modeyne?&#8221; he asked, putting his hand gently
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>She sighed, and said miserably:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Noll&mdash;but, thank God, I cannot tell you. She is
gone.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein, the Barber letting the Cat out of the Bag, we give Chase</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the gathering darkness of his dingy little room over the
southern gate of New Inn sat Noll Baddlesmere in his shirt-sleeves,
cudgelling his wandering wits for epigrams and the
dramatic situation; yet though the dun walls did not distract
his attention with the restlessness of over-abundant gaieties, nor
the sedate quietude nor the narrow view from his grimy windows
strain his nerves&mdash;indeed, he could scarce hear the turmoil of the
traffic in the great Strand hard by&mdash;he was unable to settle down
to hard work, nor could he rid himself of the fret of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>For hours he had thus striven to banish his loneliness, but our
deceptions fail at last even to deceive ourselves. His instincts
were bent on finding Betty; and the gloom of the dying day,
though it thwarted his eyesight and raised disturbing ghosts of
thought, held the whisper of the fact that he had come near to the
flying glimpse of her. It was as though her skirts had rustled
across his dreams in the ornate halls of the Malahides, flipped
into a baffling doorway, and vanished into mocking silence&mdash;yet
but a door between. He fretted that he could find no slightest
trace of her.</p>

<p>He flung down his pen; arose from his desk in the dusky
gloom; dressed for the street; and strolled out of his rooms aimlessly
into the grey of the evening that held the old quadrangle in
a smoky stillness.</p>

<p>In the vexed traffic of the Strand he suddenly bethought him
of Devlin; and straightway turned his steps towards the barber&#8217;s.</p>

<p>As he reached the corner of the street where Devlin plied the
scissors, he saw Myre hail a hansom and drive off in it.</p>

<p>Noll, entering the barber&#8217;s room, was greeted by the little
cockney Irishman with frantic delight; and Noll himself was glad
to step back across the threshold into his old world.</p>

<p>He gave up his hat to the dandified little man and sat down in
the barber&#8217;s chair before the mirror, the little man fussing about
him the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devlin,&#8221; said he, lying back in the chair, &#8220;I saw Mr. Myre
leaving this place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>Devlin flung a large white pinafore round the youth and tied
it at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, sir,&#8221; said Devlin. He tucked some white towels
under his chin. &#8220;And faith, it&#8217;s quite the great man he is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoho!&#8221; said Noll&mdash;&#8220;affluent and well-to-do, eh? I suppose
he has quite divorced himself from Art, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; screamed Devlin, stopping his lathering.
&#8220;Mr. Myre divorced from Art!&#8221; He went to the door to see that
it was carefully closed. &#8220;Whisht, sir; it&#8217;s a fine hairy libel-action
ye&#8217;ll be wadin&#8217; in at the police courts, Mr. Noll, if ye don&#8217;t hold a
restraint on ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my good Devlin&mdash;he always swore that reward and affluence
destroy the artist!&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin laughed; and got back to his lathering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Noll, it&#8217;s your old self, it is&mdash;findin&#8217; flaws in the Irish
logic of him.&#8221; He chose a razor. &#8220;By the book, I remember
well the day Mr. Lovegood pulled the leg of the great man here.
Ye&#8217;ll remember it, maybe. No?&#8221; He held Noll&#8217;s chin with
damp fingers and began to shave: &#8220;Well, says Mr. Myre, says he,
it&#8217;s death and to the devil with art when the artist works for
money and reward, says he. That&#8217;s so, says Mr. Lovegood, for I
always thought meself, says Lovegood, down in the great resoundin&#8217;
belly of him, says he: I always thought meself, says he,
that Willie Shakespeare would have turned out less indifferent
poetry, says he, if he hadn&#8217;t been trying to fill the stalls in his old
Globe Theatre all the time, says he, and makin&#8217; eight thousand a
year, present reckoning, out of the damned blank poetry of him,
says he.... Mr. Myre he licked his lips, wid a black sullen look
on him, like a dog that&#8217;s been robbed of his bone. And, by the
powers, the most simple law officer of the Crown could have foretold
that Mr. Myre was going to have a sudden engagement in the
city thin and there from the wan smile that came over the head of
him. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He concentrated his whole attention for a while on the upper
lip of Noll, and having shaved it, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the black mental gloom that got a holt of the great
man that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; asked Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said the barber. &#8220;Oh, yes.... And ye didn&#8217;t
hear tell of it, sir?... Mother of God, it was the talk of the
sivin continents.... Ah, begod, sure it&#8217;s a damned penny-whistle
this Fame, anny way. Ah, sir; it was a great fall that,
mind ye. He took it like Julius C√¶sar with the Opposition takin&#8217;
hacks out of him under Pompey&#8217;s pillar&mdash;just wid a wan dignified
look on him.... Oh, yes; he&#8217;s a great man. If stickin&#8217; to it,
and the divil&#8217;s own confidence in one&#8217;s own greatness, and industry,
and strong opinions and histrionic adultery can make
genius, that man&#8217;s a barrel of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was drying Noll&#8217;s face, and removing the shaving-cloths
from about his chin when the cling of the door-bell gave warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that someone had entered the outer shop&mdash;footsteps came towards
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whisht!&#8221; said the barber, &#8220;here&#8217;s Mr. Cartel Maungy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whisht! I&#8217;ll tell ye when he&#8217;s gone, Mr. Noll. Sure, the
paper&#8217;s lyin&#8217; about there somewheres&mdash;and I&#8217;ll have done with
the gintleman in three minutes forty-five seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded, and betook himself to a seat, suspecting some
mystery that the barber would divulge after his own quaint
fashion, which brooked no hurrying&mdash;to end in some fantastic
nothingness or a good story.</p>

<p>The door opened, and there entered, sedate and old-aired, a
handsome dandified little old gentleman.</p>

<p>The barber, with gorgeous bow and diffident formality, relieved
the silent man of his hat and cane, and leading him to a seat, soon
had him swathed to the chin in cloths, and was shaving the soap-lathered
ascetic face that gazed at the ceiling meditatively.</p>

<p>The shaving being done, and the swathings of many white
cloths removed from about his chin and shoulders, the courtly
figure arose from the chair, and being given his hat and cane by
the even more elaborate barber, he withdrew from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir; he&#8217;s a kind of Frenchified poet av the name of
Cartel de Maungy.... The gintlemen call him The Man of
Pallid Ideals,&#8221; said the barber. &#8220;The gintlemen were saying
only last night that he&#8217;s been a bit of a literary genius in his time
in the minor poet line; but Misther Myre he says the man&#8217;s but
an Inkstain on the Carpet of Time. Oh, but it&#8217;s a trenchant
tongue Misther Myre&#8217;s got on him when he gets handlin&#8217; the comparisons
against literary reputations&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Devlin&mdash;never mind Mr. Myre. About this man of
pallid ideals&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The barber lowered his voice to the confidential:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now that&#8217;s a mighty queer story, Mr. Noll. It&#8217;s the
victim of the grand passion that man is; Vanus rest his soul.
Victim? begod!&mdash;he&#8217;s the hero of a romance that&#8217;s kept a holt
of him since his chin began the need of shavin&#8217;&mdash;and that&#8217;s as long
as your grandfather or mine can remimber the seasons. That
man has just played on the music of his little love-affair until he&#8217;s
clean pulled the cat-gut out of the old fiddle&mdash;plucked at the
shtrings of the old melody until he&#8217;s torn the bowels out of the old
harpsichord of Romance.... Sure, my father shaved him
before me, and remembered the day it got about that the girl&#8217;s
father swore he&#8217;d have no damned Frenchified poetaster for son-in-law.
And the little gintleman&#8217;s been lovin&#8217; the girl ever since,
until there&#8217;s only the memory of them both left to each other.
He might have married the little lady this forty years&mdash;the divil
a soul to prevent it&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and gave up the tangle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he goes and walks before her doorway every evenin&#8217;, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the twilight falls, and sometimes they take a stroll together. And&mdash;by
the same token! she lives in the same house where Miss
Betty lodges&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>The barber was startled.</p>

<p>Noll strode up to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does Miss Betty live?&#8221; he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>The little barber gazed at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t ghosts ye are seeing, Mr. Noll?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Noll put his hand on the other&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, man&mdash;where is the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now&mdash;Mr. Noll&mdash;ye&#8217;re pullin&#8217; the innocent leg of me,&#8221; he
said, laughing.</p>

<p>Noll pulled himself together. He strode to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Devlin&mdash;for God&#8217;s sake! Which way does&mdash;the&mdash;the
man of pallid ideals usually go?&#8221; he asked roughly.</p>

<p>The barber followed him to the street, and standing in the lamp-lit
dusk he pointed out the way:</p>

<p>&#8220;Up there, till ye reach that turn by the red pillar-box, then
sharp to the right&mdash;then straight on till ye&mdash;&mdash; Begad, he&#8217;s off
like a policeman down the kitchen steps when the area belle&#8217;s
a-ringing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood gaping at the vanishing figure of the youth who strode
up the street.</p>

<p>The little man&#8217;s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>He scratched his poll aghast:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of God!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;of coorse! Victoria May Alice
told me&mdash;there&#8217;s been a misunderstandin&#8217;&mdash;or maybe even a
partin&#8217;&mdash;or some heathen tom-noddy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked into his shop soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike Devlin,&#8221; said he&mdash;and he rubbed his chin ruefully:
&#8220;ye&#8217;ve put your great damn foot slap into the big drum of the
farcical tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll strode out. In the glimmering grey of the hustling world
he tramped; but the hush was alive with whispers&mdash;and the blood
was jumping in him.</p>

<p>He caught sight at last of the distant back of the Man of Pallid
Ideals.</p>

<p>He turned, after some walking, into one of those silent streets
that give off the noisy thoroughfare of the roaring city, and by
the silence he knew that he was in a street where lodgings are. At
once he slackened pace, for, a hundred strides before him, walked
slowly the slender Man of Pallid Ideals, who at last halted, stood
a little while looking up at a window across the street, sighed, and
passed brooding into the twilight beyond.</p>

<p>Not so Noll.</p>

<p>He marked the halting-place, paced the distance, and swung
round towards the house opposite.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>In the topmost window was a light; and Noll knew that by
that light was Betty sitting&mdash;that the light was on her nut-brown
hair&mdash;kissing her cheek&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He strode straight across the road, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>When the maid opened the door, Noll said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see Miss Betty Modeyne at once, please&mdash;lead the
way to her rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid, used to the unquestioning obedience of orders, when
given with authority, led the way upstairs, regardless of all the
proprieties, careless of etiquette....</p>

<p>Arrived at the topmost landing, she threw open the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;A visitor to see you, miss,&#8221; cried she, wheezy at the high
climb; admitted the handsome youth; and forthwith took herself
off, descending to her household furbishings and area gossip.</p>

<p>Betty, rising from her chair, set aside some needlework, and
turned to greet. She saw the youth standing before the closed
door, his back to it.</p>

<p>She put her white hands upon her bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll!&#8221; she whispered; and a glad smile of wonder was in
her eyes; and the red blood flushed her cheek and lip.</p>

<p>Noll went to her and put his arms about her, and kissed her
upon the mouth. And he said never a word.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which, in Somewhat Indelicate Eavesdropping Fashion, hovers

Conversation</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the wintry twilight that came hazing softly down upon the
city, and cast its dusky shadow over St. James&#8217;s Park, sat Noll
on a bench, and by his side was Betty Modeyne. He sat stooped
forward, elbow on knee, chin in hand, and gazed at the girl&#8217;s face
lovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou dearest heart!&#8221; said he; and she reached out her
dainty gloved hand and took his within her slender fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have brought delight to me again&mdash;the
day and night are full of song and all the world is grown musical&mdash;you
paint the very greys of life with colour. I am glad to be alive&mdash;for
you feed my eyes with dreams of you and my senses with
the fragrance of you. It would be enough to be alive, but you
have filled me with eagerness, my bones with strength, my body
with will.... I cannot sit idle longer, nor be content with half-life....
You must marry me, dear heart; and we will go to
Paris and begin living splendidly and a-new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Noll,&#8221; said she, smiling down upon him; and she
stroked his hand. &#8220;We are so young, and&mdash;I am so glad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed for love of her:</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not have us grow old in pretty nothingness, thou
dearest of all born things,&#8221; he said impatiently&mdash;&#8220;like the Man
of Pallid Ideals and his little faded poetess, dreaming themselves
away in a fragile world of dreams! My Betty, it cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head provokingly.</p>

<p>He pshawed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not live by denials alone, you sweet dreamer,&#8221; said he,
feeding his eyes upon her eyes&mdash;&#8220;we are here to live our life&mdash;not
to shirk the living.... Our feet are planted on the dear
brown earth, and only so may we raise our heads amongst the
stars.... They prate of other worlds who themselves after all
only judge of other worlds by the glorious life that their dullard
eyes so scorn in this.... They hold out heavens to us! but
what trumpet blast of all the sepulchral souls in heaven shall stir
a man like the touch of your dear lips?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>&#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;I did not say I did not love your
lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed quietly, kissing her gloved fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are not your very hands exquisitely fashioned but to steal
away a man&#8217;s heart, my Betty? Why does your white self hold
me enthralled unless it be that I may love you&mdash;not the vague
image of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Noll,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;if you forget me as wholly as you
have done these two years, I can almost bear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were becoming obliterated, sweetheart,&#8221; said he hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;yet
you were not leaving me free. Other women&#8217;s skirts
were rustling in my ears, but your fragrance came between. Now
these others are all silent&mdash;I hear only you. You must set me no
dullard task of loving a vague image of you. I love you, dear
heart&mdash;and I must love you. I want nothing more. I will have
nothing less.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for awhile; and she held his fingers lovingly.</p>

<p>He roused:</p>

<p>&#8220;They speak gravely of the vague loves of gods and angels;
but what is all their thin love to the love of a man for a woman?
What do the unbodied gods know that is half so sweet as the love
of a woman for a child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;you are wasting argument upon me&mdash;I
love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised her gloved hand to his lips and kissed the warm
fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only drifted&mdash;aimlessly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I am done
with this monk&#8217;s life. This day three weeks you come with me to
Paris, mated to me. And I will go through my apprenticeship to
art and letters and win a wage at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;Noll! you must not throw away a certainty&mdash;you have
an allowance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow&#8217;s face darkened:</p>

<p>&#8220;I discovered from my father, only yesterday, what was the
price of Wyntwarde&#8217;s allowance to me&mdash;and I have written to my
cousin that he may keep his money&mdash;I go my own way.... He
is a man that stands hotly enough on the nobility of his blood; I
asked him what was the benefit to me of that blood if it bound
me to menial practices. I told him I would be no paid accomplice
of his, or any other man&#8217;s&mdash;that I will pay him back his services
to me before I count myself a free man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Noll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you are going to ask, Betty. No; my father
and I did not part on the best of terms. I did not think that my
father would have sold my freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty sighed.</p>

<p>Noll heard the sigh, and came out of his brooding fit.</p>

<p>He took her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Betty,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;we must not fill this dear trysting-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
with glum ghosts. I love you, sweetheart&mdash;and I have no
love for such as would rob me of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Noll&#8221;&mdash;the tears came brimming to her eyes&mdash;&#8220;I do
not want my love to be a pain to all these others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done nothing to give them pain, dear heart,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;They have brought their own pain.... Why did my
father sell me? It is not you that come between us, but the
shabby husk of him.... The last generation cannot wholly
understand. Each new brood must live its own experience.
Why should he put the brutalities between you and me? He is
not your lover, nor can his choice of loves be mine.... There
are limits to obedience. They have nearly starved me, body and
soul&mdash;they have, by their folly, even turned my hungry eyes to
the poor women of the streets. And for so poor a reason....
But&#8221;&mdash;he looked at her gladly&mdash;&#8220;you have won me back myself,
dear heart&mdash;the world is very sweet to me this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent forward and put her dainty hand upon his cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Noll&mdash;but I wish we had not to steal our meetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not your fault, Betty&mdash;nor mine. They force us to these
secret ways.... I was glad to spend my boyhood openly by
your side&mdash;I loved you, not knowing it. And they must needs
break into our pleasant garden and put us apart&mdash;and set us
brooding on the very glory they would keep us from. And now
what was a pleasant glamour, by their starving of it, has burnt
into flaming passion. I am no longer content to see you beautiful
by my side; I must kiss you. I love you, Betty&mdash;the rest is
nothing. We&#8217;ll leave the reasons and the excusings to the calculating
gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand, and pressed the fingers between his own.</p>

<p>And she laughed happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;The disreputable part of it all is that I love you for it, Noll,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>He arose, and gave her his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Betty, I fear you may get chilled,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you see&#8221;&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;&#8220;I can even set love&#8217;s egotism aside, when yours is
the gain, and deny myself the sweetest moments&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand and arose; and they walked into the
twilit city together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night, by the candle-light in his narrow lodging, Noll wrote
a letter to Paris, whereby Horace was urged to bestir himself and
find rooms for a youth and his bride.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which discovers something of Despised Poetry in a Waste-paper
Basket</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll,</span> the door having closed on Betty&#8217;s skirts, took his way in
the darkness of the lamp-lit night towards Soho.</p>

<p>He turned to his most loyal and closest friend to secure him as
witness to his marriage.</p>

<p>As he went, the young fellow forestalled in his mind all the
questions that Gomme&#8217;s searching humour might ask. Why was
he going to Paris? He scarcely knew. He had some vague
idea that he must see life before the creative gift of artistry could
be his. He had some even more vague idea that he would see
such life in Paris. His instinct told him that life would be easier
for Betty there&mdash;she would not suffer slight. He knew that life
would be gayer at a far smaller price. His young blood was
jumping for a change.</p>

<p>He must be moving&mdash;doing.</p>

<p>He roused at Gomme&#8217;s doorway, ran up the steps, and rang the
bell.</p>

<p>The house was in gloomy darkness, and, the door being opened,
there stepped into the resulting blackness the grim grey figure of
Netherby&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mrs. Gomme, how are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The youth hailed her, and entered the hall. And he added, as
the door was closed behind him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You look unhappy, Mrs. Gomme.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am feeling a little lonely, Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Netherby in?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Her mouth shut firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone out,&#8221; she answered grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He has gone to meet some fool of a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll whistled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>There was an uncomfortable pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;God only knows. But come in here, Noll,&#8221; said the old lady;
and led him into her little sitting-room. She lit the gas; went
to her writing-table; took a rumpled piece of paper out of a
drawer, and handed it to Noll.</p>

<p>Noll smoothed out the piece of paper, glanced at the grim old
face before him from under his brows; and read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;There&#8217;s glory in my dear love&#8217;s hair,</div>
<div class="indent">Sweet fragrance hath great part in it;</div>
<div class="verse">The threads have caught my feet in lair,</div>
<div class="indent">And tangled is my heart in it.</div>
<div class="verse">The beckoning laughter in her eyes</div>
<div class="indent">(With the shy look therein)</div>
<div class="verse">Now wins me to her, then denies</div>
<div class="indent">The sweet lips and the chin....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The old lady watched the reading keenly.</p>

<p>When it was finished, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that in his waste-paper basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fie! Mrs. Gomme!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll handed her back the sheet of crumpled paper.</p>

<p>The old lady flung it into the fire; she sat down in her armchair
and watched it burn.</p>

<p>Noll smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mrs. Gomme&mdash;when a man is in love with a woman he
does not write poetry about it&mdash;he does it. When a man writes
poetry about love, he is not in love with love, but with reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it began like <i>that</i>,&#8221; said she, unheeding of arguments, and
jealous, brooding still&mdash;&#8220;what must the rest have been like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll laughed, and put his hand on the old lady&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mrs. Gomme&mdash;the girl has probably followed your
example&mdash;you see, the last generation set such a bad example in
these things....&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein we are shown an Emotional Hairdresser at Loggerheads
with Destiny</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was close upon midnight when Noll, baffled in his attempt to
find Gomme, his feet jigging restlessly to a new music that was
in his ears, stepped it out through London town, as a man will go
on the eve of momentous decision in his life, to visit the old
haunts of his boyhood.</p>

<p>As he came into the street where had been his old home, he
wondered whether his mother lay asleep&mdash;what she was doing&mdash;what
thinking.</p>

<p>He saw a light in her rooms; walked across the street; halted
before the door, half inclined to take her into his delight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the black shadows flung by the street lamp there sat in a
huddle on the topmost doorstep the silent figure of a man.</p>

<p>Noll bent forward and peered at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Devlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>The barber nodded; he was very pale.</p>

<p>He attempted to speak&mdash;uttered a rending hiccup&mdash;and was
still.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin hiccupped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sittin&#8217; on my&mdash;mistress&#8217;s&mdash;doorstep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To cool the ferment of my imagination,&#8221; said the barber
sadly.</p>

<p>Noll laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your imagination?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It
looks all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s torrid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221;</p>

<p>His pale face nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so&mdash;quite damned torrid,&#8221; said the hairdresser, and
hiccupped fearsomely. &#8220;It ferments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather unpleasant!&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contr&#8217;y,&#8221; said the barber&mdash;&#8220;quite pleasant.... It&#8217;s
in the morning my head will be bursting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very awkward indeed!&#8221; said Noll drily, humouring him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>&#8220;Of awkward I know nothing,&#8221; said the barber&mdash;&#8220;but it will
be more than unpleasant when the cock-y-doo&#8217;s begin their&mdash;hiccup&mdash;morning
song. Damn this hiccup!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Devlin&mdash;wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin laughed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish them lamps would stop sliding down the street.
Would you mind,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a great trouble I&#8217;m
putting ye to&mdash;would you mind givin&#8217; me your arm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin blinked:</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who is intoxicated with love should avoid mixing
his intoxication with spirits.... I want to take my head carefully
in both hands and put it in yon horse-trough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an ass, Devlin,&#8221; said Noll, and sat down beside him
on the step. &#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The barber coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s anarchic I am&mdash;and filled with philosophic gloom,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s rollin&#8217; round the intestines of me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! This is serious indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.... It&#8217;s damn terrible.... I&#8217;m all at sea&mdash;like a
great bumping motor-cart going down a great slithery waterfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad as that?&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than that,&#8221; said Devlin, and hiccupped. &#8220;I wish
I could get rid of this damn hiccup,&#8221; he added irritably&mdash;&#8220;it
nearly pushes me off the steps each time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Devlin&mdash;can nothing be done for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can. And I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m face to face with my great hairy destiny, and, begod,
I&#8217;ve hit it and floored it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is rather rough treatment of your destiny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The divil take it, yes. I&#8217;ve kicked it out of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll put his hand on the other&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Devlin,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;let us have good honest talk.
What&#8217;s the trouble between you and your destiny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir; it&#8217;s this way.&#8221; He tried to tell off the points
under discussion upon his fingers; but, missing his aim, he sadly
gave up gesticulation, and put his hands in his pockets. &#8220;Ye
see, sir, life is only once for the living. That&#8217;s a square fact on
a fine solid foundation. Even the Presbyterians, God forgive
them, can&#8217;t get round that with any number of testimonials&mdash;nor
the Methodies can&#8217;t leap that obstruction.... Well, that&#8217;s
so anyway. That&#8217;s the sort of statement on which all the
churches meet&mdash;the sort of statement that don&#8217;t strain the bowels
of any tax-payin&#8217; householder to grip between his two fists and
look at with the two unblinking eyes in his head.... Now, I,
Mike Devlin, said to myself&mdash;hiccup&mdash;said I&mdash;why should this
whole mortal journey of me be passed in cuttin&#8217; the stray bits of
hair off every damned fool whose hair grows? and wid that, up
gets Echo on his hind legs in the dirty old shop and answers: why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
indeed?... Then, by the holy army of martyrs, up comes the
trump of doom and starts buglin&#8217; in me ears like the leadin&#8217; trombone
in the band of a travellin&#8217; circus: Mike, me boy, says the
trump, there&#8217;ll be a funeral one day, and the shabby section of the
world that lives in your dirty old sooty street will be passing by
the ugly corpse of ye, one by one, and they&#8217;ll stare at the damn
comical old relics of ye, and say: And this man was contint to
crawl through life and sneak into his grave clippin&#8217; the hair off
the head of any ass every week, rain or sunshine, for a triflin&#8217; and
mean remuneration!... And wid that, I scratched me head,
and thinks Mike Devlin to himself, thinks he: begod, it&#8217;s a queer
kind of poetry ye&#8217;re livin&#8217;, says he; and wid that he up and
kicked me destiny in the intestines and drapped the hair-cuttin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that, Devlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Devlin hiccupped:</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been three days ago; and it might have been
less; but it seems a godlike fortnight av dreams interspersed wid
hiccup and one or two nightmares, Mr. Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are you going to do, Devlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Live,&#8221; said the emotional hairdresser splendidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoho!&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to live&mdash;to take the stage in the drama of life,&#8221; said
the barber largely; and he swept his hand towards the pitchy
reek of the slumbering universe. &#8220;There&#8217;s a great hairy soul in
me, tearin&#8217; to get out&mdash;and it&#8217;s above hair-cuttin&#8217;. I am moved
with the spirit of art.&#8221; He hiccupped, apologized, and went on:
&#8220;I have joined me life with the legitimate drama&mdash;I mean to
dance the mighty fling of man&#8217;s destiny to the tune of a nightly
orchestra. I go out to-morrow wid a theatrical company to play
the immortal masterpieces of Mr. Sheridan, Doctor Goldsmith,
and the Swan of Avon. And, by the gospels, Victoria May Alice
goes with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll whistled.</p>

<p>Devlin scowled:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s an ignominious destiny she&#8217;s got
a holt of&mdash;cleanin&#8217; the boots of mediocrities and lodgers....
I&#8217;ve been christenin&#8217; the great event all week wid the heavy man
of the company&mdash;but I lost the fellow about Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;er&mdash;is Victoria May Alice to be your lawfully wedded
wife, Devlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir&mdash;of course it would have been more dramatic not.
I&#8217;ve struggled with the damned poetry in me; but, in case of the
children comin&#8217;, I thought I&#8217;d have a commonplace corner in me
destiny and the marriage certificate.&#8221; He leaned over confidentially.
&#8220;Ye see, sir&mdash;no one in the profession need know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;er&mdash;what part are you to play, Devlin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin as baggage man,&#8221; he said loftily&mdash;&#8220;risin&#8217; to great
parts according to me genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Victoria May Alice?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Pompey Malahide&#8217;s</span> old rival was in all the agony of writing
a letter, and neither Isaac Tankerton Wollup&#8217;s fat little hands
with the grasping pointed finger-tips, nor his bulky body, nor
his spelling, aided too well in the recording of his talents on paper.
The company promoter held a cigar between the forefinger and
second of the hand that held down the sheet of paper to the desk,
and he blew and drew the breath of his body whistling through a
thick nose as he snored over his labour:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Samuel</span>&#8221; (he writes to his friend the money-lender
at Oxford)&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>&#8220;Nephew Reuben McCubbie whispers me that the
old lord has done the handsome thing by the young Baddlesmere
cub; and that is as I said it should be. By the Christian gods, I
should have been a minor prophet in the clear air of Jerusalem,
and might even have got into the Talmud&mdash;but we live in dull
days. London&#8217;s a sooty hole when all is said&mdash;even intellect
shows dimly, except on the Stock Exchange. Greatness has to
bump against the neck of the Anglo-Saxon race before the Anglo-Saxon
race sees it. Therefore I am neglected.</p>

<p>But I am worried just now with the details of an affair
that forces itself upon me even more prominently than my
obesity.</p>

<p>My great illustrated paper has now been going for nigh six
months. All the little pen-and-ink gods of criticism agree that
it is the most artistic, the most brilliant, the best produced thing
in the market&mdash;all agree even more that it has shown up the
tawdry vulgarity of Pompey Malahide&#8217;s literary debauches.
But&mdash;it has cost ten thousand pun!!!!! Please note the hysterisks.
It&#8217;s quite as bad as all that. Not a one of the artists
has been paid&mdash;nor not a one of the literary gents. I was not
born for nothing&mdash;nor the bankruptcy laws made to thwart commercial
genius. I got them to go in on sharing terms for the
first six months&mdash;the profit as well as the risk to be theirs instead
of going into the pockets of sordid city men. See? I played the
full brass band of self-interest to their conceit and greed&mdash;which,
Samuel, I fear is at the bottom of much human nature, even outside
Judea. Well, the trade is a-owing to the harmonious tune
of eight thousand pun. And the trade has decided to stop the
concern and divide what shilling in the poundage is owing thereto.</p>

<p>I am the trade. See?</p>

<p>The McCubbie syndicate. See?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t appear. See?</p>

<p>So don&#8217;t you burst into tears for me. I lured the boys with
dreams beyond avarice&mdash;I showed them Pomp Malahide and the
girls driving by! They gave their genius whole&mdash;like the gentlemen
they are.</p>

<p>Well, we have failed to elevate journalism. It must lapse
back into its old sordid channels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am about to put in a bailiff in the name of the
McCubbie printing syndicate upon the carved oak chest in the
hall of our superior friend, Bartholomew Doome&mdash;that lordly
person, being always backed with money in some mysterious
way, having confessed, pathetic fact, that he had absolutely
no settled income beyond what he makes from year to year by
the exercise of his talents. Not that I have anything against
the youth&mdash;I rather like the Nobs; but them tapestries! real
goblins, my boy! they are mine.... And the pictures!
Bouchers are running into five figures at the sale-rooms; Samuel,
they are mine. And as for the Watteau&mdash;what ho! <i>And</i> the
Adams and Chippendale and Louis furniture and the whole
splendid treasure! You could almost kiss it, Samuel&mdash;well, I
think that we are going to get our eight thousand back, God be
praised. But it will be the Sabbath in seven minutes, so I must
cease from honest labour&mdash;and I prepare to do so in a reverent
spirit, for it is one of the brightest Friday afternoons I have spent
since you and me played marbles in the Minories.</p>

<p>God be merciful to you a sinner.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">Yours, in the plentitude of my powers,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">I. Tankerton Wollup</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When, in the early morning, Fluffy Reubens, yawning in a
loose dressing-gown as he shuffled along muttering guttural
curses at the violent ringing of the bell, opened the outer door of
Doome&#8217;s studio, and thrust out a tousled head, a melancholy
man came in with the milk, walked gloomily to the oak chest in
the hall, and took possession.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens shut the door, went over to the seated man,
and, thrusting his hands deep into the pockets of his dressing-gown,
and straddling out his legs, stood and gazed at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee-hee-hewy-hewy-hewy!&#8221; whistled he.</p>

<p>The cadaverous sickly-looking fellow on the oak chest, watching
him suspiciously out of anxious eyes, searched in the breast
pocket of his dingy coat, and handed him a sheet of blue paper.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens kicked it out of his hand; and the sickly
person ducked his head and raised a defensive elbow:</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck it, guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; he said hoarsely&mdash;and coughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk slang!&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sickers,&#8221; said the sickly person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you that name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are yer gettin&#8217; at, guv&#8217;nor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look here, Sick Horse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; &#8220;By thunder, sick-horse
is good.&#8221; And he added: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bailiff, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting used to shame, guv&#8217;nor.&#8221; The man was seized
with a fit of coughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look beastly nervous, Sick-horse. You&#8217;d think I was
going to kick you from behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sickers sighed gloomily:</p>

<p>&#8220;The last gentleman did,&#8221; he said hoarsely; and added, with
a dry throat: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very assailable calling, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Sick-horse,&#8221; said Reubens&mdash;&#8220;I want you to go
out and send a telegram for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you don&#8217;t, guv&#8217;nor.&#8221; The man smiled cunningly,
laughing a husky laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yer see, guv&#8217;nor&mdash;when I&#8217;ve got my back on a oak
chest&mdash;well&mdash;I know where I are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reubens laughed loud and long:</p>

<p>&#8220;You ass,&#8221; roared he&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got slippers on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not, guv&#8217;nor&mdash;if yer don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens gazed at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick-horse,&#8221; said he, &#8220;don&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ll be back again
in a minute. Stay like that for awhile&mdash;you look terrific in that
light&mdash;sort of Judas Iscariot in the gloom wishing to God he
hadn&#8217;t taken the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strolled off into the great studio and returned with a canvas
and painting materials, and a large yellow official paper. He put
the things on the floor, drew up a chair, and, shading his eyes with
his hand, tried several views of the uncomfortable man.</p>

<p>Sitting down at last, he began rapidly, with swift telling strokes
of colour, to sketch in an impression of the dejected figure
before him where he sat in the deep shadows of the ill-lit place.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Sick-horse,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I suppose I must put
you down in the census-paper&mdash;you are going to stay the night,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes, sir,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I&mdash;Mr. Doome has lent me his studio, so let us begin.
We&#8217;ve got your name and your calling. Are you of unsound
mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t put it at that, sir,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a fizzing fine suicidal look on you, when you don&#8217;t
smile, Sick-horse,&#8221; said Fluffy, painting away. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
pining for a good Judas Iscariot for years.... Don&#8217;t shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
more than you can help.... Oh, about the census. Are you
married?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pale-faced man nodded gloomily&mdash;he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! How dreadful!&#8221; said Fluffy. &#8220;No wonder
you&#8217;re ashamed of yourself. What&#8217;s become of the wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s alive,&#8221; he said gloomily.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;No luck,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Any children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t always think so, guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; said the melancholy figure
from the shadows.</p>

<p>Reubens painted in silence for a long time. At last he got up
and looked keenly at the man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The bailiff nodded&mdash;yes, he was very empty&mdash;he was always
empty&mdash;he was used to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Sick-horse, you look so damn dramatic I must
not put anything into you for half an hour yet&mdash;I haven&#8217;t quite
finished. But after that we&#8217;ll have breakfast, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man smiled.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens jumped up, upsetting his canvas:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; cried he anxiously; &#8220;or
we&#8217;re lost.... Quick! think of something else&mdash;think the
coffee&#8217;s burnt&mdash;think the eggs are addled&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung down his brush:</p>

<p>&#8220;Damnation! Judas Iscariot is dead,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He went to the hall-door, bawled for the woman who looked
after the house, and ordered breakfast from an eating-house
close by:</p>

<p>&#8220;For two,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>He gathered up the painting things sadly, to carry them into
the great studio.</p>

<p>The gloomy man on the oak chest coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real sorry, guv&#8217;nor; I&#8217;ll try the God-forsaken lay again,&#8221;
said the wretched man huskily; &#8220;but I wish to God you hadn&#8217;t
mentioned them sausages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens&mdash;&#8220;it would never be the same
thing&mdash;and I haven&#8217;t the heart to kick you&mdash;even if it brought
back Judas Iscariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later in the morning, Fluffy Reubens wrote a telegram to
Bartholomew Doome:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Bailiff in possession. Order a supper for about thirty here
this evening. Whisk round London in cab and make all the boys
come to an orgy. The bailiff looks ripping in that gorgeous livery
out of your property wardrobe. The shoes do not fit, but his
elastic-sided boots look stunning quaint at the end of the white
stockings. Was afraid I&#8217;d never get his feet through the legs of
the red plush breeches. I will do the rest.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fluffy.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He wrote another to Rippley.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Palace of Art disappears in the Night</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bartholomew Doome&#8217;s</span> great studio was in a haze with the
smoking of much tobacco; and it were almost as though the
lolling figures had smoked in church.</p>

<p>The tapestried walls showed sombrely rich, their glowing colour
only half revealed by the ghostly light of the huge white candles
that flamed on high, held aloft by great gilt candlesticks the
heavily wrought feet of which stood reflected on the dark-stained
floor. And the handsome sheaves of crystal lustres that hung
from the ceiling glittered and sparkled aloft like hundreds of
precious gems.</p>

<p>The beautiful image of the Mary and the spangled ikons of the
Russian Church, which stood on the suavely carved mantel,
flanked by the pastel of a ballet-girl by Degas, and a frail nude
beauty by Manet, gleamed mysterious&mdash;religious.</p>

<p>Before the mantel, on huge iron dogs, was set a scarlet coffin.</p>

<p>On the scarlet coffin sat Bartholomew Doome.</p>

<p>About the room, seated at tables, young fellows were bawling a
drinking chorus.</p>

<p>Before Doome stood the weak-kneed figure of the bailiff,
gorgeous in an ill-fitting livery that was a world too capacious for
his meagre body.</p>

<p>As the drunken fellow held the tankard of beer aloft he made
a supreme effort to take a last high note&mdash;his voice cracked&mdash;he
spilled the liquor on his upraised face, spluttered, coughed,
tripped over his own feet, and fell&mdash;amidst a shout of laughter
and loud cries of &#8220;Encore&#8221; from the assembled throng.</p>

<p>Rippley and Fluffy Reubens carried the fallen man to a sofa
and laid him upon it.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the riot; and in the lull there arose from his
chair, unsteadily, the figure of Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott, rather
the worse for drink. Holding a glass in his hand, he straddled
over to Doome, where he sat on the scarlet coffin, and he uttered
a silly laugh as he brought his vague legs to an unsteady halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Ffolliott!&#8221; cried Doome. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott blew through dry red lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Civilization,&#8221; said he, with a racking hiccup&mdash;&#8220;civilization
(hiccup) has its drawbacks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Ffolliott.&#8221; Doome laughed. &#8220;Civilization has its
drawbacks&mdash;there is the hand mirror.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott came nearer, and, disregarding the insinuation, added
with drunken confidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, Doome&mdash;you don&#8217;t mind my saying so&mdash;but I
believe you&#8217;re engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Ffolliott!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome got up from his grim bench and slapped the weak-limbed
exquisite a sounding thump on the narrow shoulders with heavy
jocular hand&#8217;s buffet, so that he spilled the liquor down the front
of him.</p>

<p>Ffolliott, when he had wiped himself dry with dandified handkerchief,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;it&#8217;s no use your pretending to be so colossally gay, you
know. I always notice that when a fellow makes a delirious fool
of himself (hiccup) about a woman (hiccup) he becomes austere&mdash;morally
austere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hiccup!&#8221; said Rippley; and there was loud applause at the
tables.</p>

<p>Doome laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always a comic ass, Ffolliott,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;but when
did you degenerate into a philosopher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;get me off the rails, of course! But I always notice
that when a fellow makes a delirious fool of himself about a
woman (hiccup)&mdash;fool enough, I mean, to become engaged&mdash;he
becomes mollar&#8217;ly (hic)&mdash;mollarly austere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, damn!&#8221; said Doome.</p>

<p>Ffolliott raised drunken eyelids:</p>

<p>&#8220;But saying damn can go with great moral austerity.&#8221; He paused
and uttered a giggle. &#8220;That&#8217;s an epigram, I think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you jabbering about, Ffolliott?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott stuck to his theme with drunken persistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fellow who is engaged doesn&#8217;t seem to laugh at the same
places in the <i>comedy of life</i> that he laughs at before he is engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on, Ffolliott&mdash;get on. You talk like Euclid trying to
invent a comic song.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott blinked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always noticed,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;that a fellow does not become
really austere until he is engaged....&#8221; He sighed heavily. &#8220;I
know such a good chap, who&#8217;s become engaged. He used to read
the <i>Pink Un</i>; but now he reads <i>The Descent of Man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shush!&#8221; said Doome impatiently.</p>

<p>Ffolliott giggled:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I started to tell him such a comic
story to-day&mdash;by George, I&#8217;ll tell it to <i>you</i>,&#8221; he tittered. &#8220;You
know how ridiculous a woman with a pronounced nose looks in a
bathing-dress! Well. But&mdash;perhaps I&#8217;d better not tell you&mdash;I&#8217;m
<i>sure</i> you&#8217;re engaged&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome slapped the narrow shoulders again with jovial hand,
and sent more liquor flying down Ffolliott&#8217;s trousers:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Hermes, you are a clever fellow, Ffolliott,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;not always,&#8221; bleated the affected voice of Ffolliott&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
rather deliriously clever at times&mdash;in a flukey sort of way.
I don&#8217;t mean to be. It&#8217;s hereditary. My mother&#8217;s uncle was a
rural dean, you know, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you wear an eyeglass?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott simpered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Foljambe of Baliol was the most pronounced man at the
&#8217;varsity; he is the most pronounced man at the bar&mdash;and Foljambe
wears an eyeglass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Does</i> he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; bleated Ffolliott. &#8220;And though, between you and
me (hiccup), Foljambe&#8217;s a conceited ass, he is rather a remarkable
ass; and I don&#8217;t know whether you have noticed it (hiccup),
but in these days it takes rather a clever fellow to be a <i>remarkable</i>
ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome smote Ffolliott a rollicking buffet, that sent more liquor
down his trousers:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Greek gods,&#8221; cried Doome, &#8220;we are having a roaring
evening, eh? Hang me, we are only bachelors once&mdash;so we&#8217;ll
make gay whilst the moon shines. Damn it, you shall sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I&#8217;ll sing. I can&#8217;t&mdash;but I will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens came up and pushed Ffolliott aside roughly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Doome, the bailiff&#8217;s asleep....&#8221; He
turned round and called in a loud whisper: &#8220;Rippley!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got the furniture vans all ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my studio,&#8221; said Rippley. &#8220;I hope to Jupiter the horses
haven&#8217;t knocked the stuffing out of my stattoos. I tipped the
men to stay all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! Get &#8217;em round, Rip, quick&mdash;by the back way,
and into the court here&mdash;the door of the dressing-room opens into
the court, and was made for taking big pictures through. There&#8217;s
not a moment to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, boys&mdash;one of you lock the hall door after Rippley!&#8221;
cried Fluffy Reubens hoarsely; &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to pack out the whole
parcel of toys in a couple of hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung off his coat, and began to roll up a great Persian carpet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the early morning, the sleeping bailiff was roused by a rude
hand upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; said a rough voice.</p>

<p>He sat up, untidy, frowsy, weak-eyed, snuffling and grumbling
in the ridiculous gorgeousness of the ill-fitting livery.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said he hoarsely.</p>

<p>His jaw dropped; and he stared miserably round the room.</p>

<p>Before him stood the vulgar overdressed figure of Mr. Isaac
Tankerton Wollup, with his choleric eyes fixed upon him, bullock-like,
bloodshot:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>&#8220;You blighter!&#8221; said Mr. Isaac Tankerton Wollup.</p>

<p>The miserable man rubbed his drowsy eyes&mdash;he rubbed them
again. His mouth was too dry to utter speech.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the top of a scarlet coffin, that stood on two
chairs; and, with the solitary exception of these things, the room
was wholly empty of furnishment.</p>

<p>He burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bleating idiot!&#8221; The vulgar dealer&#8217;s eyes snapped contempt.
&#8220;The house is empty as a money-lender&#8217;s unwritten
promise. They loaded the vans in the night; and you slept
through it all!... Get your legs out o&#8217; the light!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck the lean shins with his cane.</p>

<p>The poor abject fellow cried out, and, rising, like a whipped cur
he slunk across the room, buried his face in his arm, and sobbed
against the wall.</p>

<p>The bloodshot eyes of the company-promoter, as he stooped
down putting his thick hands on his great fat thighs, peered at the
white paint on the side of the scarlet coffin; there had been no
haste, every letter was balanced and well-drawn, and the whole
phrase told decoratively on the scarlet lacquer: <i>Art in England
is dead</i>, it said. <i>Try France.</i></p>

<p>The little fat man laughed harshly. He shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the Beelzebub I shall break this musical
comedy to Samuel.... Overreached in my own business and
by a Christian!&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked gloomily out of the place.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>

<p>After the irate dealer had departed, his miserable bailiff ceased
his sobbing against the wall, took off the gorgeous coat, and
staunched his tears on the sleeve of his tattered shirt. He was
a broken figure of dejection&mdash;blear-eyed, weak-kneed, ragged,
snuffling.</p>

<p>He changed into his old clothes, went and seated himself on the
scarlet coffin, and crouched there, a woe-begone wonderer in despair.</p>

<p>He burst into tears.</p>

<p>He put his grimy hand into the side-pocket of his greasy coat
for a handkerchief&mdash;it struck against a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>He blew his nose on a rag, soiled to mud-colour, unfolded the
paper, and read it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>&#8220;If you should be dismissed from employment, communicate with
Sir Pompey Malahide&#8217;s butler, who will see to it that you do not
suffer. Don&#8217;t forget to call him my lord. Ecod, you sang like a
damned canary.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Poet burns his Verse to keep his Feet Warm</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the waning of a bleak March day, Betty walked briskly home
to her rooms. It was the eve of her marriage. Noll and she
were to go to Paris straight from the ceremony. Betty had the
tickets for the journey in her pocket. Horace had secured them
lodgings.</p>

<p>When the girl had entered the house, mounting the stairs to her
attic, she felt a pang. She was going to a glorious life, and leaving
the old home to increasing dinginess&mdash;it would become shabbier
and more shabby; whilst she&mdash;stepped it blithely to the seven
heavens.</p>

<p>And the little faded Miss Flora! Who was to tend her?...</p>

<p>The mirth went out of her heart.</p>

<p>Someone must always suffer.</p>

<p>She stopped at the door, and knocked.</p>

<p>She had some flowers at her belt&mdash;she would leave them for the
little lady&mdash;she must see her again before she went. More&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She must break the tidings.</p>

<p>She knocked again&mdash;the knock of indecision.</p>

<p>Not a sound.</p>

<p>She opened the door gently, and entered.</p>

<p>In the room, in her old-world taffeta-covered chair, before the
fire, very still, sat Miss Flora Jennyns; and the girl knew by the
quick instinct within her that Death waited at the window.</p>

<p>About the narrow shoulders was drawn the India shawl, the
weary hand holding the overlapping ends at the withered throat;
and on the third finger of the hand was the ring of splendid jewels
that sparkled in paint in the picture beyond her.</p>

<p>Here was the picture&mdash;grown old&mdash;vanishing.</p>

<p>And the old shoe that peeped from the crumpled threadbare
skirts upon the quaint old wool-worked footstool&mdash;ah, how
shabby! worn with careful brushings&mdash;of what gentle uncomplaining
penury were these things not sign and emblem!</p>

<p>So she sat, fading away in the winter&#8217;s light, her dying eyes on
the fire&#8217;s warmth, and her lips smiling on her little triumphs of
long ago&mdash;a little withered roseleaf, blown across the footlights
of the world&#8217;s rude theatre.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Betty ran to her, knelt down beside her, and touched the pale
white hand that lay upon the chair&#8217;s arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Flora!&#8221; she whispered in a strange wonder and alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of God!&#8221; the old lady&#8217;s lips murmured&mdash;&#8220;the child
is come!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled; put out her slender bloodless fingers, and placed
them upon the girl&#8217;s fresh brown hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear sweet heart!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;in my love for thee, and in
thy gentleness to me, I have known something of motherhood....
I have not&mdash;been&mdash;wholly&mdash;barren.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty took the bloodless hand between hers, kissed it and chafed
it. It was very cold. She could not speak for tears.</p>

<p>The old eyes smiled upon the girl. After a while the dying
poetess added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor have I been wholly alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed; and, with a smile, she died.</p>

<p>Betty, her eyes filled with tears, put out her dainty milk-white
hand, with rosy fingers, to the dead eyelids and drew down the
blinds that curtained the windows of the departed soul.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the deepening dusk, Betty went out to find Eustace Lovegood....
She mounted the bare creaking stairs to his lodgings,
and reaching his high attic, was glad to hear his deep-voiced growl
to enter at her knocking.</p>

<p>The big man, in a threadbare dressing-gown, arose, with his
wonted grand manner, to welcome her; and when he saw who
was his visitor his heavy face was lighted with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Betty!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;by all that&#8217;s charming!&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to her and, the greetings over, with courtly etiquette
led her to his chair&mdash;it was the only one in all the bare room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look serious,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;sit down and tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty hesitated:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something on fire&mdash;a smell of paper burning,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>Lovegood laughed his big laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am making coffee,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She saw that the kettle in the narrow fireplace was being
heated by burning balls of crumpled manuscript.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you heat the kettle with paper?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He smiled drily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Betty&mdash;you push me to the extremity of truth. Well, it
is because I have nothing else to burn.... Only my rejected
poems. And I am badly in need of the coffee. The weather is
very severe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s eyes filled with tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! you mustn&#8217;t damp the spirits of the kettle, Betty&mdash;it
begins to boil.... Wonderfully heating thing&mdash;poetry!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the kettle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have first brew,&#8221; he added&mdash;&#8220;that you may never
again despise coffee warmed by the passionate glow of verse....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
There is a dearth of cups&mdash;and my landlady has a gouty leg&mdash;and
the journeyings of the little maid-of-all-work make my heart ache&mdash;but
I usurp the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the big man busied himself with his hospitalities, Betty told
him of her errand&mdash;begged him to come back with her and give
his counsel and aid.</p>

<p>He was for going straight away; but she insisted on sitting
there until he had drunk his coffee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the threshold, across the steps of the house, in the twilight
of the silent street, lay the dead body of the Man of Pallid Ideals&mdash;a
nosegay of pale flowers near his gloved hand, his white face
turned upwards to the still skies, lit by the pale light of the mystic
moon.</p>

<p>He had seen the drawn blinds&mdash;guessed their significance&mdash;gone
to her doors, stunned with dread&mdash;fallen in the moment of his
last act of homage....</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Husband of the Concierge fears that he is growing Blind</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Darkness</span> was stealing over the city, and Paris was taking a
drowsy breath in the twilight before awakening to her evening
gaiety and frolic mood.</p>

<p>In her narrow old grey streets, many-shuttered, which huddle
about the broad Boule Miche that is the students&#8217; highway on the
left bank of the river&mdash;in the time-honoured Latin quarter&mdash;over
against the Ile de la Cit√©, there stands a narrow way where artists
do largely abide. In the whitest house of the block, or the one
that at least attempts the nearest to approach a dingy suggestion
of whiteness, where at any rate whiteness is become less a bygone
tradition than with the rest of its fellows down the length of the
alley, there stood at its topmost window, his hands behind his
back, and in pensive fashion, a handsome young fellow in the
slouched black hat and short black coat, flowing tie, and baggy
brown corduroy pantaloons of the student of Paris; but the
yellow hair was the hair of Horace Malahide.</p>

<p>His brooding eyes were on the end of the alley, where in the
reek of the lilac dusk Paris glittered her myriad lamps, her
flaming streets sweeping away into the shadow of the night,
showing afar dim sparks of fire that winked up the heights and
were lost in the purple firmament, where a white star trembled
into liquid light above the gaunt scaffolding of the huge basilica
a-top of the distant hill of Montmartre.</p>

<p>A cracked voice in the dark room asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur wishes that I shall light the candle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the brooding youth at the window gave answer, a match
was struck, and discovered a little old man guarding the flame of
a candle with his hand. The old fellow set the candle on a
table.</p>

<p>Horace turned, with a sigh, into the room, sat down on a chair,
and pushed back his hat; he came down into the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Husband of concierges,&#8221; said he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The little old man, with skull-cap a-top, coughed, held out a
protesting hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, monsieur&mdash;husband of <i>the</i> concierge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace laughed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&#8220;Husband of the concierge of concierges,&#8221; said he&mdash;and he held
out a jewelled box of cigarettes&mdash;&#8220;we will smoke&mdash;to disinfect
the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old shoulders rose in the shrug of protest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, monsieur, the room is absolutely polished&#8221;&mdash;the
shoulders swore it&mdash;&#8220;clean as a dish&mdash;not a grain of dust. I said
it should be so. I did not trust the <i>femme de m√©nage</i> alone. I
did it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shoulders and arms and hands, all bore confirmatory evidence.</p>

<p>Horace nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is an honour to smoke with so clean
a husband of concierges.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man laughed, shook his head, and shuffling to Horace&#8217;s
side, took a cigarette:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur the student he is always gay&mdash;always gay. He
has always his joke against his concierge.... I have known
students for thirty years&mdash;and who would have it otherwise?
When students fall away from joy of life they take to believing too
much in themselves, and cross the river to Montmartre, and drink
absinthe, and die, and are buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my husband of concierges,&#8221; cried Horace, &#8220;don&#8217;t let
us weep. Light all the candles, and let us see what the room looks
like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, monsieur, not all the candles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! certainly!... This is the last rehearsal, my old
veteran; they <i>arrive</i> to-morrow.... Light up, man&mdash;light up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man shuffled about the room in his thick felt slippers,
setting candles aflame until the place was a blaze of light.</p>

<p>Horace&#8217;s eyes went over the details of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those rogues sent a fresh new bed, eh? You saw to that,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sommier was as monsieur had ordered it&mdash;ab-so-lu-ment.&#8221;
The old man stopped in the midst of lighting a last
candle to point to the couch-ottoman that is the student&#8217;s lounge
by day and bed by night.</p>

<p>Horace nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!... The rest of the furniture, though not too profuse,
looks far from too new. We showed taste in our choice, my
old veteran. Now, you will not forget your lesson? Monsieur
Horace has sent what he did not want from his own studio; but
there was no stove nor towels, and you have taken the liberty to
buy a stove and a dozen towels which were a bargain and they
only cost you twelve francs! God forgive me! You have it all
in your head, all under that embroidered cap, my husband of concierges,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man bowed, shrugged his shoulders, and held out his
open palms in the protest of indignation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has monsieur yet known me to forget anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace blew out a cloud of smoke, frowning at his thoughts....</p>

<p>He put his hand in the breast-pocket of his coat and drew out
a bundle of banknotes. He beckoned the old man to him; put
five of them into his hand, and shut the old fingers upon them:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; said he, putting his hand on the old fellow&#8217;s
shoulder&mdash;&#8220;there will always be here, early every morning for an
hour or so, a woman, <i>une femme de m√©nage</i>, to make beds and brush
and sweep and keep things tidy&mdash;besides, you and madam will,
I know, have business up in this part of the house&mdash;at times that
will just happen to be useful to the young lady who is coming
here. There will be water wanted, and breakfast rolls and milk
and things. And&mdash;I shall not forget that you do not forget them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man nodded, smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have business on the sixth floor morning and evening,
monsieur,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and my wife also; I know of an excellent
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!... Now put out the lights.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man shuffled round the room, and blew out the
candles....</p>

<p>They locked the door and went down the stairs together.</p>

<p>Horace turned suddenly on the first landing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Husband of concierges&mdash;we have forgot the baths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu, monsieur&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be there to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be there to-morrow, m&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&mdash;my veteran&mdash;they! <i>Two</i> baths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They shall be there, m&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace ran down the stairs; called &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; and was gone.</p>

<p>The old man scratched his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said he; &#8220;how these English are always washing!
That will be two extra cans to carry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night as Hodendouche, the once Sergeant of cavalry,
joined his plump little mate in the bed that took up the greater
part of that small room in the gateway, on the ground floor where
concierges have their habitation, he blew out the candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is you!&#8221; said the stout little woman sleepily.</p>

<p>The old fellow chuckled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou didst not dream it was the President of the Republic,
my Marie?&#8221; said he, and cackled again. &#8220;If so, I like not thy
complacency.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;the <i>Petit Journal</i> lies. The English are not
<i>canaille</i>.... He gave me five hundred francs.... Our little
Aloysius shall go on with his studies.... The <i>Petit Journal</i>
lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsh! Hodendouche! Thou art grown garrulous. Get thee
into thy nightcap and to sleep. Thou fool! he loves the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221; said the old man&mdash;&#8220;yes, indeed. My eyesight
is not what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which introduces us to the First Lady of France</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">A paddle-steamer</span> cleared the long wooden jetties, and made
Boulogne Harbour, hooting the announcement of her coming to
the echoing wharves that flung back the chuckling hoot in
answering welcome rollickingly; and, churning with fussy thrashings
of her paddle-wheels the waters of the narrow sea-way as she
settled to her moorings, she lurched against the quay and was still.</p>

<p>To Betty and Noll, standing on deck with eyes bent on the
swinging prospect before them, there came the fragrance of a new
world. The tender greys, gentle blues, and silvery colours of
France held out a welcome to their ready senses, and from the
many-windowed houses with their hundred wooden shutters there
drifted the pleasant odour of wood fires.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So Betty, her happy eyes glancing at the shifting scenes that
passed by the wayside, and lolling in the grey carriage of her
wedding journey, was whirled through the pleasant garden of
France.</p>

<p>Noll came and sat beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very happy, my Betty,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She nodded&mdash;and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>She put out her hand shyly to him, and he held it in his. He
sat and watched her. It was stupid to speak....</p>

<p>They swung past great sand-dunes by the sea&mdash;along the
pleasant plains with poplars all of a row&mdash;thundered over bridges
that spanned the shining river&mdash;clanked past villages&mdash;passing
now and then a picturesque ch√¢teau on a hilltop that stood sentry
over the plains&mdash;and always there was the sense of grey-green
trees and white buildings and tender blue skies that are the colour
of France. Delicacy and tenderness and graciousness and gentleness
are written over the face of the land, the subtle land of Corot.</p>

<p>And all the world was a-singing....</p>

<p>In the twilight the train dashed past St. Denis and the foundries
of Paris, swept under the lea of the hill where the scaffolding
a-top showed the building of the great church of Montmartre,
and thundered into the resounding grey gateway of the city that
stands open to the north&mdash;the Gare du Nord.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>At the barriers they were met by a French student in black
slouch hat and great loose tie full flowing at the throat through
the open collar of his short black coat&mdash;he wore baggy corduroy
pantaloons. The golden-haired youth slapped Noll on the
shoulder, pulled off his hat, and held out a hand to Betty&mdash;welcoming
them to Paris. And Horace Malahide&#8217;s warm handshake
brought a glow of happiness to them both. His laugh
sent all the strangeness flying; they were no longer alone amid
an alien people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horace, giving Noll a hand with the small baggage, called a
porter and told him to hail a cab. The blue-bloused fellow soon
had the scanty baggage stowed away on top. Horace smiled a
little sadly at the girl&#8217;s trunk and the narrow extent of Noll&#8217;s
belongings.</p>

<p>As they drove off together, Horace explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve got you a room, right at the top, in one of the most
delightful houses of the old student quarter. I have sent some of
my surplus furniture; but I had to get the concierge to buy you
a stove and one or two things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed aside all thanks; then he coughed&mdash;a little embarrassedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;I told all the boys that you were coming&mdash;with a
wife, Noll. But the Frenchmen all winked at the word wife; so
they&#8217;ll be quite friendly and free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace was to show them everything and put them in the way
of pleasant economies.</p>

<p>In the morning he was to move down from his old studio on
Montmartre to be near them. Noll was to share his studio, when
he was in the mood to paint&mdash;Horace was at G√©r√¥me&#8217;s atelier at
the Beaux Arts.</p>

<p>The cab was rattling along the riverside&mdash;lurched aside and
rattled over a bridge&mdash;turned along the quays&mdash;up a narrow
thoroughfare&mdash;took a jolting turn or two&mdash;and came to a noisy
standstill.</p>

<p>They got out, and walked through a high entrance into a
cobbled courtyard. And as they passed, to give them rude
welcome, out of a doorway that was a hole in the wall of the
passage-way popped the stout little woman who is the symbol
and the tyrant and ultimate design created by the machinery
of the French constitution&mdash;the concierge.</p>

<p>Horace introduced them.</p>

<p>As they mounted the stairs to their first home, Horace discoursed
on the panting woman who led the way&mdash;in English.</p>

<p>The concierge, said he, is the government. The President of
the Republic is but her servant. Her newspaper has the greatest
circulation in the world&mdash;is the furthest reaching&mdash;<i>Le Petit
Journal</i>. She stands between the landlord and the tenant&mdash;that
is her sole duty&mdash;and she stands on her duty. She has
usurped power as the Carlovingian mayors of the palace plucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the sceptre from their Merovingian kings, the Rois Fain√©ants of
France. She is dragon over all the moralities&mdash;you may commit
any sin in France, if you do it gracefully, except shocking
the concierge. At eleven o&#8217; the night she shuts the gates, and
gets to bed&mdash;and when you ring the bell for admittance, she pulls
the bolts by magic from that bed, scarce turning to break her
snore, and you as you pass must call your name&mdash;or you are lost.
In her smile or in her frown lies your honour, your repute, your
good name.... France one fine morning awoke, and her
sunny smile died out, scared by the threat of Revolution. Paris
talked in anxious whispers. Paris frowned. For on the walls
of the Rue de Rivoli was writ <i>Long Live the King!</i> At mid-day
Paris was laughing&mdash;the concealed troops marched out of the
courtyards and went home; the revolution was over: beneath
<i>Long Live the King</i>, a workman, mounting the shoulders of
another, had writ: &#8220;<i>Which?</i>&#8221; killing the danger with a jest....
At midnight Paris was a riot of dancing&mdash;a third wag had written
full answer to the sphinx: <i>Le concierge</i>.</p>

<p>Arrived at the heights, Horace bade the lights to be lit, and
when their home was all ablaze with welcome, he handed Betty
the key, wished them happiness, and took his leave until the
morning.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with the Motherhood of the World</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">A clock</span> struck five.</p>

<p>The sun rose out of the grey mists of the east and flecked with
golden light the upper stories of the white-faced city.</p>

<p>Betty roused at the noises of the awakening street below&mdash;footsteps&mdash;the
clink of bottles in which young women bore
the morning&#8217;s milk to the court&mdash;then low voices that gossiped
drowsily.</p>

<p>The disturbing sense of being in a strange bed.</p>

<p>The distant rumble of a cart&mdash;and more footsteps and again
voices, of a pitch and accent that struck strangely upon her ear.
And she knew she was awaking in a strange land.</p>

<p>It came to her that she was in Paris.</p>

<p>Paris!</p>

<p>She sat up in bed.</p>

<p>There was a dear fellow&#8217;s head on the pillow beside her&mdash;he
slept soundly.</p>

<p>And she laughed low.</p>

<p>She put her dainty feet out of her marriage bed, slipped their
whiteness into his slippers, wrapped his warm dressing-gown
about her, and went to the window.</p>

<p>And as the sun rose high above the city&#8217;s edge, and smiled
down into the dew-damp streets, there came the blithe sounds
of a city awakening. The clatter of wooden shoon that entered
the alley was the sound of the great black sabots in which
tramped the big powerful woman in bunchy skirts who came
sweeping the water down the gutters with long black broom. On
the heels of her noisy passing came the rattle of a fish-barrow,
pushed by a fish-girl that wailed the melancholy street-cry of
mackerel. And now the court was all alive with sound&mdash;water-pails
were clanking, and wooden shoon tapping along the paven
way; vintners were cleaning wine-casks, swinging iron chains in
the cleansing waters of the barrels; anvils rang under the swinging
stroke of the naked-armed iron-workers; hammers tapped;
market women and street-vendors joined their cries, musical and
unmusical, to the increasing din; and the clinking bell on the
neck of a big leading short-necked Flemish horse told that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
great lumbering cart was come to carry away the city&#8217;s trash.
Girls selling fruit and girls selling potatoes cried their wares;
and men that mended chairs. And there was the cling-clink-clink
of the pavior who roughs with hammer and chisel the newly
mended flagstone. And from the blanchisserie the girls thumped
and ironed the white linen and sang snatches of song. And then
as the clock struck eight, there came a street-seller crying chickweed
for the little caged songsters; and all a-down the alley the
birds began to sing.</p>

<p>And wondrous music stirred in the girl&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>For the days of her chill maidenhood were departed, fallen from
her like a white garment; and just as, passing from childhood,
she had been roused by some unseen hand and rid of physical
bondage; just as with awakening reason she had been as surely
freed from intellectual bondage; so she now stood in presence
of the full majesty of her womanhood, morally free. Her senses
glowed, and her dainty being pulsed to a music she had not till
then known&mdash;and the meaning of the book of life was laid open
to her, so that with swelling throat and ecstatic bosom she was
at one with the motherhood of the world.</p>

<p>She had brought her little hoard of twenty-seven pounds&mdash;it
was the lucky number&mdash;three times three times three! She
laughed happily. And that handsome fellow in her bed, Noll,
had his wits and some seventy pounds a year. And they were
one; and all the world lay before them.... Hardship! What
was hardship? She had this handsome fellow to wrap her
maternal arms about. Mother of God! it was luxury&mdash;riches&mdash;God&#8217;s
reward!</p>

<p>She gave herself to him with all the shy generosity of her great
integrity&mdash;of her commanding virtue....</p>

<p>Betty went back to the bed and nestled close to her love</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Bess?&#8221; he asked, rousing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pity all mateless things,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Rich Man&#8217;s Son seeks the Sweets of Poverty&mdash;not
Wholly without Success</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the northern heights of Montmartre, into a paved courtyard,
where Horace Malahide had his rooms, several laughing students
were carrying forth the furnishments from one of the houses,
piling them in a heap on the cobbled ground. A divan was
already in the handcart, and on top of the divan sat a youth
whom they called Gaston, who, with a great brass French horn
round about his shoulders, was solemnly sounding a faulty
rendering of a quaint old hunting call.</p>

<p>Out of the hurly-burly tripped into the court a pretty girl,
carrying a couple of hat-boxes and some airy feminine wearing
apparel. She halted before the handcart in evident anxiety as
to a safe place for their stowage&mdash;a perplexed frown came over
her handsome face. One of the noisy young fellows, who spoke
his French with a strong American accent, saw her bewilderment,
plucked the musical Gaston by the heel, and brought him with
a clatter to the ground, where, rubbing the back of his skull, he
settled himself on a rug, and, fixing his mouth to the horn again,
took up the tune where he had left off. The young American
flung open the lid of the divan and stowed away inside it the girl&#8217;s
hat-boxes and scant wardrobe.</p>

<p>&#8220;That all, Babette?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mon ami&mdash;one minute!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>She skipped up the steps and disappeared into the doorway.</p>

<p>When she came back she was laden with linen and pillows and
blankets. She laughed merrily. The young American calmly
helped her to stow the things away in the divan; and she blithely
skipped away again....</p>

<p>Before her doorway, at the passage leading into the court,
watching what passed with a sour scowl, stood the hard-lipped
little woman who was the concierge to the court; indeed, it was
this lean woman&#8217;s shrewish tongue that was chiefest cause for the
flitting&mdash;a clacking tongue that had wearied Horace for months.
And now she had fallen foul of the girl and had slanged her from
the bottom of the court with taunts and insinuations that Horace
had felt compelled to put out of all remotest chance of repetition&mdash;and
a restless longing to be back in the Latin quarter leaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with his desire and hastened it. The girl was not sorry either;
but she was frugally loath to forfeit the remainder of his lease.
He had taken her face between his two hands and kissed her upon
the mouth: &#8220;Babette,&#8221; he had said&mdash;&#8220;no living soul does you an
ill turn twice if I can prevent it; we leave to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The act had sobered the concierge.</p>

<p>She was brooding upon it now....</p>

<p>The students shut the lid of the divan and flung a rolled
mattress on top; the loading went apace to the rattling musketry
of quip and jest and caper.</p>

<p>Horace, dressed for the street, entered the courtyard and was
received with a loud shout from his noisy comrades&mdash;a prolonged
blare from Gaston Latour&#8217;s hunting-horn&mdash;and there was silence.</p>

<p>Horace glanced round the court, saw that all was ready, and
moved towards the concierge.</p>

<p>He halted before her, put his heels together, took off his
hat, and bowed solemnly. Madame, he said, he felt sure, would
understand and allow for his emotion on quitting her house. He
handed the key into her grasping outstretched fingers, that were
itching for a fee, and commended her soul to her Maker.</p>

<p>&#8220;He insults me!&#8221; she cried; and the students fell a-laughing.</p>

<p>Horace turned on his heel as the violent oaths poured from the
old shrew&#8217;s scolding lips; and the loud tan-tan-taras of the
students and the brassy blaring of the French horn drowned the
torrent of abuse.</p>

<p>They began to sing the <i>Marseillaise</i>.</p>

<p>Horace walked calmly over to the handcart, took off his coat
and hat, gave them to the girl, and getting between the shafts,
he slipped the leather brace over his shoulders, and, with the help
of his singing companions, pulled the overloaded and swaying
cart towards the gateway&mdash;and lurched out into the bright March
morning.</p>

<p>Horace made southward, the cart rattling after, down the steep
streets of Montmartre towards the merry roar of the city&#8217;s holiday-making.
As the singing, shouting young fellows, hauling
and pushing the swaying cart, rattled past the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>
into the Place Blanche, they ran full tilt into the genial idle
crowd that was out to make the mid-Lenten f√™te of the Micar√™me.
From all the windows of the great boulevard thousands
of gaily-coloured paper streamers were floating downwards.
The broad damp roadway and the footpaths were strewn with
many-tinted paper confetti that lay like a carpet, muffling the
feet of the people as they moved chatting and laughing along the
wide thoroughfare. What little wheeled traffic there was went
at a foot&#8217;s pace.</p>

<p>The riot of students, with Gaston Latour blaring upon the horn,
plunged into the procession.</p>

<p>The police made a rush towards the disturbance, but only to
shrug shoulders when they reached the lumbered swaying cart:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only the students!&#8221; said they, and fell a-laughing.</p>

<p>When they turned into the Place St. Michel they came plunging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
into the noisy crowd of holiday-makers again, and their
march up the students&#8217; beloved thoroughfare was a deafening
and triumphant din.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orass&#8221; was evidently well known, and was greeted with the
honours of a king of Bedlam.</p>

<p>It was in a pause that he took, coming to a halt between the
shafts, to recover breath and give his other ear a turn of Gaston
Latour&#8217;s hunting-horn, that Horace espied Noll and Betty standing
in the throng. He called to them to come and join him.</p>

<p>So it came about that, with a laugh, and shyly enough, they
joined the noisiest crew in all Paris that mad March morning.</p>

<p>Swinging round, when they got moving again, into a by-way,
they soon came to a halt in an old courtyard not a hundred paces
from Noll and Betty&#8217;s own home amongst the stars.</p>

<p>Horace touched Noll on the arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take her up to the top rooms,&#8221; said he, nodding towards
Betty&mdash;&#8220;they are mine. I&#8217;ll be there in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty with Noll climbed up the polished, creaking old stairway.</p>

<p>In the courtyard the students got to their unloading, and were
soon carrying the things upstairs.</p>

<p>Horace hoisted a couple of chairs under his arms, and joined the
stream.</p>

<p>Betty and Noll landed in a spacious room at last, an airy large
studio that has been the early dwelling-place of more than one
man of genius; and Horace, arriving close on their heels, set
down the chairs and bade Betty welcome to his home. They
were all to lunch together as his guests as soon as the students
had set out the place.</p>

<p>The great empty room was very soon an inviting-looking habitation.
From a back room Jonkin was bringing in chairs and
lounges that had never known the handcart. And the young
fellows were cheerily laying rugs, nailing up mirrors, and fixing
the stove, singing and skylarking&mdash;the walls were soon a pleasure
to look upon, with a few posters of Steinlen&#8217;s and the Beggarstaffs,
and sketches, and gay odds and ends. The young fellows
worked away with a will.</p>

<p>The room was nearly wholly furnished, and the youngsters
were beginning to sit about, chatting and smoking, on the floor
as often as not, when the door of the little room off the studio was
flung open and the girl Babette appeared, wearing with dainty
grace the delicate fineries of fashion that a Frenchwoman knows
so well how to put on.</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence.</p>

<p>The girl halted midway down the room, her eyes fixed on Betty
where she sat on a divan under the high studio window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother of God!&#8221; said the girl hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;what a beautiful
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>The students yelled with delight.</p>

<p>The girl Babette frowned impatiently, and going close to
Horace, she whispered to him, caressingly.</p>

<p>Horace laughed, and led her by the hand to Betty:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;Babette wants to know if she may kiss you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She
says you are very beautiful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed prettily, rose from her seat and kissed her.
And, sitting down again, she drew the other down beside her on
the divan.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour, at a dig of the elbow and mutter from the
young American, started to blare upon the French horn&mdash;for
there were tears in the eyes of the laughter-loving frail Babette.</p>

<p>The conversation turned to other things.</p>

<p>Horace announced that they were all now his guests, and were
forthwith to have breakfast sent in from the restaurant near at
hand; as he spoke he noticed that the girl Babette had taken
Betty&#8217;s left hand in hers and was turning her wedding-ring
round on her slender white finger.</p>

<p>Horace introduced the others to Betty and Noll:</p>

<p>Gaston Latour, who was essaying to bring dignity to the traditions
of painting. Jack Pettigrew, the tall Yankee, whom also
they afterwards came to know together with four other American
students as one of the Five Foolish Virgins&mdash;the English students
explained, because they were always late; but the French ones
soon put the jest to roost in their open bewilderment at their
dogged belief in the monogamies. Paul Kendrick of Boston,
Massachusetts&mdash;which was the fault of Boston, and Paul wholly
without blame in the matter. Kendrick bowed. Harcourt
Phelps, another of the Five Foolish Virgins. Dick Davenant,
known as the Disturber of Funerals, being one who always
laughed in the wrong place. Dandy Donovan, the remaining
Foolish Virgin. &#8220;Gobemouche&#8221; de Morneville, who was shirking
the law, and catching flies when he should have been catching
the subtleties of philosophy and the reasons for things. He put
his heels together and solemnly bowed his close-cropped head.
And half a dozen other young Frenchmen who talked the most
ridiculous Ollendorffian English with serious unwinking eyes
masking their fooling....</p>

<p>Jonkin and the waiters, arriving with dishes and plates, burst
into the room, ushered in by Gaston Latour, gloomily blaring
fantastic joy upon the French horn, and all further conversation
was impossible until the cloth was laid....</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Spring comes a-frolic into the Court</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty&#8217;s</span> young blood danced to the blithe promise of Spring that
was in the March winds; and her heart leaped to the quickening
whisper of the awakening world.</p>

<p>The winter was over. Her sweet body sang to her of the gladness
of the world. Her light step spoke of the gaiety of young
womanhood; and her laughing eyes knew no fear of destiny&mdash;her
quick ears caught no echo, no whisper of the crack of doom, and
had she heard it she would still have gone with the calm effrontery
of youth to meet it. She skipped down the highway of life, all
dainty and delighted and unafraid. The orchestral universe
made music for her feet. She was alive. All nature smiled upon
her, even through tears.</p>

<p>The rain that pelted with sharp icy particles or chill admixture
of snow upon the window-panes, and the gusts that thundered
against the shutters and plucked at their bolts, played but the
castanets for her dancing blood, sounded but the drums for her
ready feet; she took her walks abroad in frank ecstasy of health,
and lifting her dear face to the buffeting winds she breathed into
her glowing body the emotional air that rocked the tall trees
against the swinging firmament, pulsing the sluggish life-sap to
their uttermost whistling twigs.</p>

<p>She was become a part of the motherhood of the world.</p>

<p>The protecting care that she had aforetime spent upon her disreputable
old father, she now wound about this youth. Her
mother-heart was no longer starved; forgot the suffering of
rebuff; flinched no longer, scared by dread of Shame. &#8217;Tis
true, at a sudden noise she would start fearfully still, and her
heart flutter sickeningly; yet, for the love of a youth, she would
have plucked the beard of a sulphur-stinking devil, though the
splendid insolence had scorched her sweet fingers to the bone.</p>

<p>Her honeymoon was fragrant with the breath of Spring.</p>

<p>With Noll she haunted the picture-galleries of the Luxembourg
and roamed the polished oaken floors that are the slippery footway
of the Louvre&mdash;stood with him before the Venus of Milo,
where, on gazing awhile, the wondrous marble seems to breathe
and move in all the majesty of human life&mdash;wandered before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
canvases whereon the masters have wrought colour that makes
music to the eyes&mdash;and loitered spell-bound a-top the broad flight
of steps where, poised on the prow of an ancient battleship, the
winged Nike of Samothrace stands like aerial goddess alighting
from flight.</p>

<p>Together they trudged the smiling streets of Paris that are
the drawing-room of the world&mdash;loitered at her shop-windows&mdash;clambered
up the steeps of Montmartre to the terrace, ill-kempt
and weedy, where arose the gaunt and vasty scaffolding of the
great church that the pious of France were building to the Sacred
Heart in that strange mystic agony that would hope, by taking
thought upon it and building in stone, to blot out the sins of the
people&mdash;wandered about the banks of Seine, poring over the
booksellers&#8217; boxes that line the walls of the quays with evergreen
hope of finding some good book or print&mdash;lingered in the high
vaulted aisles of the cathedral of Notre Dame, listening to medieval
litanies&mdash;loitered about the historic purlieus of the Rue St. Honor√©
and the Rue de Rivoli, and sought cheap dinners in the courts of
the old dilapidated Palais Royal, all haunted with the ghosts of
the Revolution and rustling, to quick ears, with the silk and satin
of the seventeen hundreds. Careless of the elements, they sallied
out to hang about the book-shops and rummage in the print-sellers&#8217;
trays, coming home with rare booty bought for a franc or
so, to hang upon their walls&mdash;little masterpieces by Steinlen and
others who are keeping alive the flame of art in France whilst the
State is decorating the mediocrities; and so, roaming homewards
with their prizes, they would make for their quarters in the lilac
twilight to dine in some cheap place where students dine&mdash;or not
to dine&mdash;clambering up their six flights of stairs at the end of all
with jest and laughter and muddied boots, singing a snatch of
song amidst their pleasant weariness, just from sheer gladness to
be alive.</p>

<p>Loneliness was wholly gone from the girl; she had with her
always now, by her side, one to whom she could chatter, one who
could share her silences.</p>

<p>Her letters to Netherby and Julia at this time were love-lyrics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From her balcony, Betty saw the spring peep shyly into the
court below.</p>

<p>The silent snow that had fallen yesterweek, swirling softly,
stealthily covering the earth, lying muffling white in deeper and
deeper carpet to the foot that trod the courtyard, showing twigs
and branches, otherwise scarce suspected, in white array, bowing
down the leaves of evergreens&mdash;all in a night in solid whiteness
fell to the ground, sliding from tree and parapet and ivied wall,
and sank into the earth below, vanished beneath the gravel,
leaving the damp cobbles shining darkly wet. In the night the
rain had swept the snow from the face of the world&mdash;the morning
laughed with sunlight&mdash;vasty white clouds swung across the blue
firmament. The fat little concierge sallied out upon the high
heap of gravel that had lain all winter in a corner of the courtyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and with a long shovel in her sinewy arms she flung abroad the
pebbles, spreading them wide over the whole space. Swish!
she sent them flying against the box-hedge that was the ragged
border of the flower-bed along the walls&mdash;and swish! they went
spirting to the furthest corners.</p>

<p>This devilish spreading of gravel satisfies the √¶sthetic sense of
concierges; and a run of the rake keeps it easily tidy. It is like
the speech of concierges&mdash;gritty and utilitarian.</p>

<p>It was more. It was a grim recognition that Spring had
tripped in from the country and glanced into the court; it gave
the official sanction. And lo! in the beds, almost in a day, bare
bushes were straightway sprinkled with emeralds, the desolate
laurels and evergreens roused from their drooping and showed a
lighter greenness above their sombre steadfast habit; the tall
lilacs ventured upon timid unfoldings. A hazel dangled catkins.
The ivy on the walls, washed clean, glowed darkly green, hiding
in grotesquely bulky nests the consequences of the loves of multitudinous
sparrows. The sparrow no longer sat, one of many, a
brown huddle on bare branches, a confessed beggar and one of a
gang of greedy loafers, shamelessly indigent, but was become
almost a rare sight, shooting like clay pellet from a sling across
the void of the court and flinging into the green, his egoism lost
in family cares, his life no longer the killing of dull time nor recklessly
planned for the debauching of the years.</p>

<p>On the bare branches of the trees the impatient buds were
swelling to the bursting. Along the brown earth showed themselves
diffidently the rare wind-flowers. In the warmer corners,
amongst much green of leaves, peeped the occasional violet.
The briar came into leaf. The branches of most trees and
bushes were bare, but in the corner an almond burst into blossom,
blushing to greet the rude kisses and boisterous onset of the
spring.</p>

<p>Then the concierge&#8217;s tortoiseshell cat, patched yellow and black
and white, alone suspicious of the elements, walking a-tiptoe in
dandified discomfort across the puddled court, flirting the loathed
sense of dampness from disgusted paw, blinking unemotionally
even at the sparrows, would show sudden uneasiness, turned
and cantered home again to the black hollow of the concierge&#8217;s
doorway&mdash;went gliding in&mdash;disappeared. A black cloud swung
up across the blue, rolled out beyond the chimney-pots and
blotted out the sun; the wind, sneering amongst the evergreens,
lost its temper, leaped forward with a roar and a yell and
smote the ruffled ivy upon the walls&mdash;bombasting round the
empty court, bursting in at the windows, sending loose shutters
a-clattering, and viciously slamming doors. Rain came spitting
upon the city&mdash;hissed the hail.</p>

<p>Thus sadly and somewhat sullenly the twilight would fall.
But Spring, though hesitant, left a footprint even in the stony
garden of the concierge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>April came smiling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>The buddings of March gave place to the green leaf. May had
not yet put her pied bravery on.</p>

<p>The concierge would stand on the gravel and hold out a hand
to the sunshine, feeling it between her fingers.</p>

<p>Nay, there had been even lack of rain for a couple of days
or more. The pump in the court would tell with clanking
report that the sinewy arms of the stout little concierge were
at work on the iron handle, usurping the habit of the clouds
and foster-mothering the narrow garden. Waddling, bucket-laden,
to the thirsty earth, she would lean and fling sheets of water
in the face of all green things&mdash;insolently, lest nature might
deem her servile&mdash;and, the roots holding firm each hardy plant
that had withstood the harsh winter&#8217;s enmities as it reeled from
the courtesies of her rude ministry, the concierge was moved to
ambitions of gardening, digged holes in the stony beds, brought
out potted plants and set them out in rigid rows into the quickening
earth&mdash;pansy and lily and anemone and daffodil&mdash;with, drill-sergeant
to their marshalled ranks, an occasional oleander bush.</p>

<p>The lilac came into bloom. The naked ash still showed black
buds, but all else was sprinkled with leaves. The horse-chestnut,
coquetting with the romping winds, unfolded little fans of green.
And now, in the blue heavens above, white clouds were lightly
roaming. The sun had warmth in his breath, and across the
seething face of the awakening world flung restless shadows.
On a high chimney a couple of pigeons sat cooing.</p>

<p>There was the blithe song of birds.</p>

<p>The concierge&#8217;s tortoiseshell cat would come out and sit in a
comfortable huddle of drowsiness upon the sun-warmed ground.
Indeed, there had been strange, devilish, and Wagnerian music
of late at night, and her modest eyes and demure person knew
full well whose tortoiseshell lungs had been the source and set
the key. Her nod could incriminate the black tom that sang
the throaty ill-timed contralto to her shrill love-music&mdash;indeed,
he sang under the whip. Even so might a concierge tell her love.</p>

<p>And there were voices within open windows&mdash;and heads thrust
out, pretty heads amongst them&mdash;and lively chatter would pass
across the court, and jests were flung from story to story, and
genial sarcasms would reach the concierge, who flung back time-honoured
repartee and time-worn ironies. There was laughter
and the singing of a snatch of song&mdash;a piano would run up the
gamut of a scale. From afar the tuneful hum of the murmurous
city sounded deeper, and there was increase in the passing clatter
of the nearer traffic. The air was astir with the sayings of many
mouths, the thrill of dancing thoughts.</p>

<p>Through the open window the setting sun, streaming into her
room, would find Betty at work, till Noll should come for her
from the studio to take her out. He had tacked prints upon the
walls above her desk, and there were books scattered about, and
a pleasant picturesqueness held the place.</p>

<p>From the early morning, when she arose blithely, put out her
rosy-tipped white feet upon the floor, and got to the warming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the coffee at the cheerful stove and set the place astir with happy
industry, making up the wonderful sommier, the bed of the
students&#8217; quarter, into a lounge for the day, and the like offices,
until the twilight, when Noll came home, and they went out to
dine at some cheap place with other students, Horace and the
Five Foolish Virgins and the rest, Babette sitting next to her&mdash;all
was one long delight of living. The mid-day meal at the
restaurants had soon had to go; but she was well content enough,
for she could make her own coffee, and he is a glutton indeed who
is not content with the bread of Paris.</p>

<p>As the sun&#8217;s amber light passed from the court and crept up
the eastern wall, and the grey shadow of the dusk began to fall,
full of chill other shadows, that took their stealthy stand in dark
corners, and made a conspiracy of silence at the heels of the dying
day, the air was filled with a mystic sense of evensong. For, when
shutters were drawn to, by silent hands, and windows one by one
were closed, and lamps gleamed yellow through the slats of close-shut
jalousies, her lover&#8217;s feet would be leaping up the stairs, and
in the deepening blue of the heavens a myriad white stars be set
aflame.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is hinted that it were Best to &#8220;Touch not the Catte botte
a Glove&#8221;</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was in and around and about the lithe beauty of the dark
slender young woman, Gabrielle Solignac, much of her own strange
uncanny poetry, with its stealthy Eastern manner&mdash;catlike when
she moved, glowing in colour as a ranging leopard, her clinging
draperies loading the air with scent of sandal-wood and the
fragrance of Japan&mdash;catlike when at rest, and warm-hued and
alertly languid as the Indies, her skin now showing saffron as dyed
wood, now gleaming white as cunningly wrought ivory. She was
mystic always as some half-revealed god in the great shadow
of the deep hollows of pagan temples&mdash;silent and calm as Egyptian
Sphinx.</p>

<p>Her exquisite fame had passed beyond Paris, and was broadcast
over Europe; yet she was little more than girl....</p>

<p>She had been married to Myre a month; and as she now lay on
her side at full length along the great Eastern lounge, her dark
head on her father&#8217;s knees where he sat at the end of the lounge,
there was something of leopard grace in her attitude; and in
the long half-closed green eyes, something of leopard&#8217;s latent
fire.</p>

<p>Solignac, his great head bowed, chin sunk on chest, lay back on
the lounge, his eyes staring out from the black shadows of their
deep hollows under the heavy brows; and he passed his shapely
nervous hand over the girl&#8217;s tawny hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It only seems but yesterday,&#8221; said he hoarsely, &#8220;that he
praised my sonnets&mdash;and I brought him here.&#8221; He laughed
bitterly. &#8220;I brought him here. Think of it, my Gabrielle; had
he not praised my verse I had never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, father!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems but yesterday that you married him&mdash;and went out
and left me alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I am so glad to be back. It was horrible&mdash;to
be a woman. I am so glad to be a child again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have gained,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and, by God, I am almost glad he
is a villain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>She put up her arms, pulled down his great head, and kissed his
cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done with him,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that I am amongst the greatest European authorities
upon the mysteries of the East! and all to be juggled out of my
wits by the first vulgar sycophant who sings my praise!... Ye
pagan gods! how little wisdom is in books!&#8221;</p>

<p>She reached up her slender hand and put her fingers upon his
mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;let us back to our books and rejoice in
our lack of wisdom. We were happier with our curios and the
mysteries.... I am done with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all about them the little fat Eastern idols sadly smiled and
smiled....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poet never recovered from the blow. He felt that through
his conceit alone his girl had been bought. He would harp upon it
sadly. She laughed always her soft low laugh at all his self-blame,
purring of her love for him. But Solignac was a disillusioned
man&mdash;thought the world wagged chins at him&mdash;lost
heart&mdash;stooped beneath the secret shame of the blow. The
blunder about his girl&#8217;s marriage killed him....</p>

<p>As he lay still and cold upon his white bed, at midnight, the
great candles flaming in their high brass candlesticks, idols of the
East gazing sadly down upon him, the girl, who had flung herself
beside the bed, her bowed head on his chill unanswering hand, of
a sudden ceased her sobbing and stood up. She bit her finger
tips upon the urging of some sudden mood, gazing stealthily about
the room. She was alone.</p>

<p>She walked, with strange catlike tread, to an exquisite lacquer
cabinet; opened the lock, and lifting the lid, took out a red
Japanese fan.</p>

<p>She went to the dead man&#8217;s bookshelves and took down Solignac&#8217;s
last volume of sonnets&mdash;the pages were uncut.</p>

<p>She sat down at the foot of the bed. How often she had so sat
as a child! He had had such pride in her!</p>

<p>The high flames of the great altar candles flooding her with
their light, cast shadows down upon her where she crouched over
the book.</p>

<p>She gripped the handle of the fan in her long supple fingers
and plucked a bright blade from out the cunningly wrought
scabbard&mdash;the fan had only been in the outward seeming, most
wondrously carved.</p>

<p>The blade was a cruel one, and keen as pitilessness.</p>

<p>She cut the pages of the book with it&mdash;and as the paper hissed
its surrender to the sharp blade&#8217;s thrust she smiled. But in the
smile was little mirth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across the river, in the students&#8217; quarter, brooding before a
wood fire in the rooms of his hotel, sat Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty
Macloughlin Myre.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>He was worried.</p>

<p>He had written a play, choke-full of the most obvious symbolism.
It had failed. It was not even considered original&mdash;indeed,
it had been condemned as being very poor Ibsen indeed.</p>

<p>Nor had he won money out of the venture.</p>

<p>He was sadly puzzled.</p>

<p>Not to be original! it were not to be Quogg Myre.</p>

<p>He searched the history of genius to find a precedent on which
to act&mdash;to be original.</p>

<p>He arose on to his splay feet, and with his awkward slovenly
gait paced the room, shivered at the discomfort of his thoughts,
walked to the fireplace and stood brooding at his image in the
mirror above it; his hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.
His untidy colourless hair fell over his paste-coloured forehead&mdash;it
was more untidy than usual, more colourless. A hank of it
stood out on the back of his poll like the crest of a cockatoo. He
was sickly pale. His weak puffy red lip was limp and uneasy.
His long quarrelsome chin alone held firm for bouts of decision.
It was his chin that fought the slacknesses of his body.</p>

<p>How had Shakespeare and these clever fellows discovered their
great art? Why should not <i>he</i> create a school? These fellows&mdash;Shakespeare,
Dickens, Balzac, Carlyle, Meredith, Sterne, and the
rest&mdash;they had been just real live men, needing their dinner,
sleeping o&#8217; nights, fighting their way to fame year after year,
rebuffed, sneered at, ordinary human flesh&mdash;without half his
chances. What was the trick that they had discovered?</p>

<p>Ay; what the key to their wizardry?</p>

<p>These fellows, the big ones, had never fretted their souls with all
these frets of style, of art for art&#8217;s sake, of their rating by jabbering
classifiers in the eternities. Whilst he&mdash;he had wasted the years
on such tom-follies. Nay, in expressing themselves they had
created style. They had had something deeper than style. What
was it?</p>

<p>There was something deep down in the heart of things that made
their work live. Some mystic sense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>By heavens, it was mysticism!</p>

<p>He would get up mysticism&mdash;read it up at the libraries. He
would write mysticism into his work&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He shivered.</p>

<p>In the curio shop, a fool of a Jap had drawn a sharp dagger from
its sheath that morning&mdash;he hated knives and edged tools.</p>

<p>God! how cold it was!</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Solignac lay stretched on his death-bed. He had a mind to go
and see him lying so.... This Solignac must have died enormously
rich&mdash;his collections were world-famous.</p>

<p>He went and put on his hat and cloak; lurched to the door&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At the door he hesitated.</p>

<p>Have a care!</p>

<p>Look to thyself, master Myre! That leopard quietude, the
catlike lithe walk, may be the watchful prowl of one that sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
more than thou with all thy blatancy and bold staring of fish-like
grey eyes&mdash;perhaps, too, fears less. Bluster thou canst outbluster&mdash;but
the silences thou canst not understand.... Wherefore
thou shalt not dare that silent woman beyond the goading point
of thy vulgarity&mdash;if thou be wise. Have a care.</p>

<p>He shut the door&mdash;came back&mdash;took off his cloak and hat&mdash;flung
them on a chair.</p>

<p>He would like to have flouted this cold woman in that death-chamber;
it had never been done, it would come well in his autobiography;
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What had this woman heard&mdash;guessed&mdash;seen&mdash;in that first
month?</p>

<p>Damnation! He had been so careful&mdash;so circumspect. He
recalled the warm accents frozen to cold disdain almost before
they had left her father&#8217;s house. She baffled him&mdash;made him
uneasy. He had scolded, supplicated, whimpered, blustered....
What chiefly remained in the fearful hollows of his conceit was
the passionless voice in its last statement that if he stepped across
her door again she would kill him.</p>

<p>On his soul, he had been glad to be rid of her.</p>

<p>She alarmed him. He had jested about her to his fellows&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He shivered uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Yes. This woman alarmed him. He felt that his throat might
be slit as he slept.... He rather liked a wordy brawl with
women&mdash;he had his moments in drawing-room cynicism. He
could brow-beat them with the best. He had pen-courage too.
With a pen and ink-pot he was absolutely without fear. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With this silent woman he never could shake off the feeling of
discomfort. She baffled him. He feared her.</p>

<p>By God! he had it. He would write a book upon all his
gadding loves with women&mdash;she should figure there <i>as one of
many</i>. She would free him in the divorce courts.</p>

<p>And the scandal would float him into public notice again.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Yankee Doodle is bugled&mdash;with a Strong Foreign Accent</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hearing</span> her name called, Betty roused; and, crossing the room,
went to the balcony. Looking down into the court she saw the
Five Foolish Virgins standing there below with faces upraised.
The big fellow, Dick Davenant, called up that his cousin Molly
wanted Betty to go to her straight away&mdash;wanted her along&mdash;before
her guests arrived&mdash;she was giving a &#8220;tea&#8221;&mdash;they would
meet later&mdash;when they had gotten the cakes and looked up &#8220;the
boys.&#8221; All this bawled at the top of his jolly lungs&#8217; strength.</p>

<p>Betty called down that she would go.</p>

<p>The young fellows waved their hats and marched out of the
courtyard, chattering.</p>

<p>Betty wrote upon a half-sheet of paper that she was off to Moll
Davenant&#8217;s, and pinned it on the wall where Noll must see it on
entering the room; and, quickly dressing for the street, she let
herself out of her room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moll Davenant was sitting on the side of her bed, seized with a
harsh attack of coughing&mdash;sitting there, clutching the bedclothes
with her long thin fingers. The perspiration came out in a heavy
dew upon her white skin. The struggle for breath was terrible,
pathetic.</p>

<p>When she took her handkerchief from her mouth it was stained
with blood.</p>

<p>She passed long slender hands over her damp brow and with
deft fingers made a weary effort to get order into the bedraggled
disorder of her mouse-coloured hair.</p>

<p>She moaned miserably, and her eyes roamed heavily over the
littered room before her&mdash;&#8220;I shall never get this place tidy,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>There was a sharp brisk knock.</p>

<p>The door opened and Betty stepped into the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious, Moll!&#8221; cried she, glancing at the litter of the untidy
place, &#8220;we must be quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had shut the door behind her when she entered; she now
went back and locked it.</p>

<p>Moll Davenant rose from the bed with the sudden and feverish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
energy of a consumptive, and ran to Betty&mdash;the shadow of death
gone from her haggard face&mdash;the hunted look departed from her
great glowing eyes&mdash;a flush of delight painting the pallid features.
She flung her arms about Betty:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven, you are come, Betty&mdash;I was at my wits&#8217; end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty gently unlocked the girl&#8217;s embrace:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Molly,&#8221; said she, taking off her gloves and jacket&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
no time to lose&mdash;they&#8217;ll be here in an hour. Gracious!
What confusion!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed gaily.</p>

<p>Moll Davenant looked about her helplessly.</p>

<p>Betty kissed her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Molly&mdash;where are the fineries? We&#8217;ll start
with the sommier.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tidied the bed coverings, and before the other, languidly
sighing, had brought some faded silks and embroideries from a
box, Betty had made smooth the wondrous bed of the Latin
Quarter to its intention of many-coloured lounge by day. Betty&#8217;s
quick fingers were soon hiding all signs of bed under silk and satin.
She arose, flushed from the tuckings-in, and the smoothings-out;
and, taking an edge of battered silk pillow-case in her teeth, she
slipped a pillow into it, shook it into place, and buttoned it down.</p>

<p>As the pillow disappeared into its crumpled once-gorgeous
covering, the last sign of bed-hood passed out of the bed, and the
sommier took on the splendour of an Eastern ottoman.</p>

<p>Betty laughed; sat down on the edge of the ottoman, and ran
her eyes over the room.</p>

<p>Moll Davenant went to her, flung herself on the floor at her feet,
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Betty stroked her shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, Molly,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;we must get on. Don&#8217;t be
stupid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl made a pitiful effort to stop her sobs.</p>

<p>Betty stood up; raised the poor girl to her feet; and led her
to the stove:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Moll&mdash;we&#8217;ll talk as soon as the room is in order....&#8221;</p>

<p>Wherever Betty went, order resulted. The easel was swung
into position and a sketch placed upon it&mdash;sketches were set out
on a ledge that ran along the wall. Chairs were slewed into position.
And soon there was but a little pile of stray impossible
things in the middle of the room that had no ordered place therein.
Betty completed the pile with a pair of dingy slippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;it is time to bury the refuse.&#8221; And the
two of them, laughing, soon had the litter thrust under the bed.
A silk hanging descended over it, and it was gone. Order was
everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll finish the coffee,&#8221; said Betty&mdash;&#8220;you go and tidy yourself,
Moll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty made herself tidy, and, flushed with the exertion, sat
down on the lounge:</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho!&#8221; sighed she.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>Moll Davenant came to her, and nestled on the rug at her knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Moll, what is it? But we had better unlock the door&mdash;all&#8217;s
clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to go to the door.</p>

<p>Moll drew her down by the skirt:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Betty&mdash;not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty sat down and drew the dainty head into her lap:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Molly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated, and added miserably&mdash;&#8220;I ought
never to have come to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because there is no one to look after father&mdash;and&mdash;he
never said a word to prevent me coming to Paris&mdash;he said he
thought it would be just splendid for me&mdash;but&mdash;I know now how
lonely he is&mdash;he&#8217;s such a <i>man</i>&mdash;he never said a word to hinder me
leaving him all alone&mdash;never said a word that hinted of the lonely
home I left behind me&mdash;but&mdash;well, it was the night before I left,
I was lonely and got out of bed and crept downstairs, and he was
sitting at a table, a lighted candle beside him, and he was looking
at a little pair of shoes&mdash;they were the first little shoes I ever
wore&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She fell a-sobbing:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I know&mdash;I know&mdash;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laid her hand on the girl&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Moll&mdash;you are going home to America within the year!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought never to have come here&mdash;we are so poor&mdash;I have
crippled their means&mdash;I have crippled father&mdash;I am crippling dear
old Dick&mdash;and I am only a mediocrity after all. And now I am
doomed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Moll! You mustn&#8217;t say these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was seized with a violent attack of coughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty&mdash;I just wanted to be a genius&mdash;to be talked about. At
heart I only wanted to be an artist in order to make a name. It
was the name. Now&mdash;I have awaked to find&mdash;I am a woman.
I&mdash;have&mdash;only a little while&mdash;a little, little life. I know it. Why
fear it? Don&#8217;t shake your head, Betty, dear heart&mdash;the doctors
broke it to me this morning.... But&mdash;I would just like to have&mdash;played&mdash;with
a child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! mistress Molly,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;so there&#8217;s a man&mdash;at
last!&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty turned up the girl&#8217;s face between her hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eustace Lovegood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty bent down and kissed her:</p>

<p>&#8220;You happy thing!&#8221; she said. &#8220;And how on earth did you
come across Eustace Lovegood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were a whole month in London before we came on here&mdash;Eustace
and my cousin Dick took to each other&mdash;and&mdash;so&mdash;everything
came about.... We knew nobody and were lonely&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Eustace made the sun shine&mdash;he helped us to Paris&mdash;he
said we could live so much cheaper here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Moll&mdash;what became of Eustace&mdash;and&mdash;the sunshine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in Paris. Has been in Paris for nearly a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! and you&#8217;ve been keeping the sunshine all to yourself,
Moll! Tut tut!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll burst into tears.</p>

<p>Betty stroked her cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Moll; this will never do. Where&#8217;s the sunshine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll nodded through her tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the girls at the studio said he was making me ridiculous.
And&mdash;I told Eustace. And&mdash;yesterday morning he wrote to tell
me the girl was right&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s brows were knit:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do, Moll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty drew the dainty head within her lap:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou fool!&#8221; she said in French&mdash;it seemed less harsh, whilst
just as true; and, after a while, she added in English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou poor mad fool, Moll!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll was sobbing miserably.</p>

<p>Betty sat and soothed her, running her healing hand over the
sobbing girl&#8217;s hair, and thinking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy!&#8221; she said at last&mdash;&#8220;fancy! Eustace Lovegood!&#8221;
And she looked down at the fragile figure at her knees. She saw
that the slender frame was grown more sadly slender&mdash;the thin
hands more sadly transparent&mdash;the fire of the strange and awful
disease was eating her blood. The girl was torn with the feverish
energy of the devil of consumption, that whispered urgingly at her
elbow to live her moment at the topmost pitch of energy or she
would be too late.</p>

<p>Betty was roused from her brooding by the shuffle of footsteps
that ascended the stairs outside&mdash;and the sound of light-hearted
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moll, quick! here they come!&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent down and kissed the girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me think it out,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;we must do something.
I&#8217;ll do it. I know Eustace Lovegood well.... Now you are
hostess&mdash;stand up&mdash;and take command of yourself.... That&#8217;s
right.&#8221; She sprang to the door, unlocked it, and skipped back
to the other.</p>

<p>There was a loud knock.</p>

<p>The Five Foolish Virgins trooped in, headed by Gaston Latour,
playing on the French horn what was soon discovered to be
&#8220;Yankee Doodle&#8221;&mdash;with a strong French accent.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein we skip down the Highway of Youth</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Saturday</span> night.</p>

<p>The Boule Miche was ablaze with light of frequent caf√©s; its
roadway vexed with roar of wheeled traffic; its pavements astir
with shuffle of many feet.</p>

<p>From the Place Saint Michel, where the black waters of the
stealthy river washed her quays in darkling passage to the far sea,
the broad thoroughfare of the Boule Miche, the students&#8217; highway,
flaring in the black reek, swept upwards to the shadowy gardens
of the Luxembourg, topped the hill, and was lost amongst the
stars. Riverwards, where the Ile de la Cit√©, with sombre hint of
law-courts and hospital, arose from out the flood in the pitchy
murk of the night, loomed the dark cathedral towers of Notre
Dame, gloomy with threat of eternal punishment to transgressors&mdash;and
low down and afar gleamed the weeping lights of the
Morgue, where sleep, after their last violence, the disowned and
discarded dead.</p>

<p>But neither above on the limitless blue, where are the stars, nor
below on the unthinking litanies of an outworn creed, nor upon
the rude death that ends alike the abstemious nun and the dizzy
jig of Folly and Crime, were bent the thoughts of the multitudinous
students who ranged the highway, making holiday&mdash;indeed,
their eager eyes were wholly set upon living the conventional unconventionalities
of youth, skipping down the highway of life
with shout and laughter and song and merry riot, arm in arm, in
rollicking mood, reckless of the flitting years, careless of the eternities.</p>

<p>It was midnight, and the Bal Bullier being at an end, its frantic
dancings done, and its doors closed, the youths were pouring into
the Boule Miche with much rustle of prettily dressed young
women who hung upon their arms&mdash;and were hovering about the
lighted spaces where the caf√©s blazed into the street.</p>

<p>The sombre academics enwrapped in the darkness of the alleys
at either hand, and the professors who snored in their staid beds&mdash;what
mattered they? Away with pompous thinking, when the
blood&#8217;s jigging. And if they were awake even the most learned
of the old gentlemen, with fullest sprinkling of dandruff on collar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
shall he explain the thrill that is in the kiss of a woman&#8217;s lips, or
add a tittle to the glory of it in the explaining, for all his learned
researches? It is there, for the getting, and it holds none the
more magnificence for the dissecting of it. Youth is theirs but
for a fleeting too little while&mdash;and the blood is a-jumping&mdash;and
there is life&mdash;and the love of woman&mdash;and the laughter of wine&mdash;and
the joy of song&mdash;and pleasant comradeship. Revelry if you
will; but the dear earth is for the enjoying. Tush! youth is not
for the denying. And there is no time for arguments, or the gladness
of life is flown almost before the rubbing of bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>God! what it is to breathe! to love God&#8217;s design by living it.</p>

<p>What hath philosophy done but make the world yawn, thou
numbskull dreamer of dreams that shouldst be living dreams?</p>

<p>This is life. The miracle is given to you. What is changing
water into wine to this? Take it in both hands. Grasp it.
Live it. All the thinking of all the academies cannot give you
this. Grown old in mere thinking upon life, you shall not call
back the blithe days of your youth. Dig your hands deep into the
grave of your dead self, and you shall not find the splendid years
of the joy of life. Get you up to the uttermost mountains&#8217; tops,
dive you to the bottom of the uttermost deeps, you shall not find
it. It was yours. Whilst you brooded hesitant how to spend it,
it hath slipped your fingers, passed like a sunlit merriment, and
become part of a sigh in the eternal mystery. The lordship over
vasty continents shall not yield you the glory of it&mdash;neither
ambition nor riches nor learning nor immortality shall yield you
a shred of that which, wholly unasked for, was yours.</p>

<p>God! how lavish, how wasteful, thou!</p>

<p>Why hug the skeleton of life? Fool! peer thou hard enough:
yonder, at the end of all, in the shadows, stands the Reaper&mdash;down
the roadway grimly smile the sombre mutes standing impatiently
by a plumed hearse, expectant of fees. Alike for saint
and sinner and gay and sober they smirk. They take your
measure. &#8217;Tis waste of time to protest with them. The rascals
have the last word.</p>

<p>Tush! Go hang to them!</p>

<p>So they sing in the tavern on youth&#8217;s highway&mdash;and toss off the
toast&mdash;and are merry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the Caf√© Harcourt, at a table, in an angle somewhat
apart from the scintillating din, sat Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin
Myre and the exquisite Aubrey. The Honourable
Rupert Greppel also was there, hidalgic, aloof, aristocratic; and
Lord Monty Askew, leaning his chin on the jade handle of his
cane, and gloved with sleeved gloves, like a woman&#8217;s&mdash;he, too,
being aristocrat, could not live without the attention of the crowd
whom he despised in speech and verse. And as Rupert Greppel
uttered his splendid contempt of humanity, Askew would nod,
giving Greppel the polite attention of his eyes&mdash;his thoughts the
while on his own pose and poesies. Aubrey too was gazing at
himself in a mirror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>Greppel was airing his hidalgeries, regretting that all hope of
the hunting of peasants with dogs was lost in these vulgar days of
democracy.</p>

<p>Quogge Myre was about to yawn openly, when his roving gaze
fell upon the handsome face of Bartholomew Doome at a table
near by, where, on either side of him, there sat two of the most pronounced
beauties of the Latin Quarter. Myre caught the eyes of
Horace Malahide, who with Babette at his side also sat at Doome&#8217;s
table; and he nodded and smiled through his colourless untidy
moustache at the young fellow.</p>

<p>The two beautiful young women were turned to Doome, gazing
upon his handsome face with hungry eyes of admiration. Gaston
Latour, sitting opposite, was leaning forward, stroking the gloved
hand of one of them where it lay upon the table, Doome listening
to him with an amused smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Liane,&#8221; said Latour, &#8220;the English are good fellows, but
they cannot love.... Conjugate their verb: I lof, thou loffest,
he lofs, ve lof, you lof, zey lof&mdash;it is like coughing into a passionate
woman&#8217;s ecstatic ear&mdash;it is born of their fog&mdash;as well kiss a
haddock!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young women smiled away the sally pityingly, keeping
their rapt eyes on the Byronic Doome.</p>

<p>Gaston grinned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221; said he, &#8220;he has not even an Englishman&#8217;s
excuse for existence&mdash;he is not even rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women had arisen, scowling at each other&#8217;s handsome
faces, their beautiful lips set angrily, and began to quarrel
about the seated Doome, who thrust his hands into his pockets
resignedly, and sat grimly silent through it all.</p>

<p>Words were like to come to blows between the two women, for
the hot-blooded Liane, to reach the other, moved out to battle&mdash;the
other retired slowly up the caf√©, her reckless rallies as she
withdrew bringing all eyes to the disturbance.</p>

<p>Women stood up on chairs and tables, to see the details; and
the students thundered applause, and threw in comic suggestions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last word is with Liane,&#8221; shouted a great burly fellow
with a big laughing voice, an artist; and added: &#8220;Tiens! what
a Juno, hein!&#8221;</p>

<p>Liane turned her pretty back upon them, and the wit ran down.</p>

<p>She came back to her seat beside Doome; sat down; and laid
a hand upon his sleeve:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was thy fault,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Doome looked at her grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now call me a fool, Liane,&#8221; said he grimly.</p>

<p>The tears came to her eyes.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour went and sat down beside her, touched her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Liane, you must not contradict him. It
is the privilege of genius to utter the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him, the tears in her eyes giving way to sad
laughter. Latour, with mock absent-mindedness, kissed her:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, pardon&mdash;I forgot,&#8221; said he; and so led back the laughter.</p>

<p>Doome smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive Gaston, Liane,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He forgets
everything&mdash;he even forgets himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl leaned on Doome&#8217;s shoulder, turned to Latour:</p>

<p>&#8220;He says I am to forgive you, Gaston,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I love
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took Doome&#8217;s hand in her lap, and stroked his fingers
between her gloved hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the English,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Gaston looked shocked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no&mdash;not so many as that!&#8221; said he, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t proper....&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Betty, led by a waiter, and followed by Moll Davenant and
Noll and the Five Foolish Virgins, peering at the light, entered the
flare of the caf√©, looking for places, unable to find seats under the
awning outside, she heard her name called, and, looking round
upon the merry crowd, she saw Babette signing to her to go to
their table.</p>

<p>But Noll had been recognised, and there were loud shouts for
him about the caf√©, and hands held out. His genial ways, his
frank habits, his kindly tact, had early won the hearts of the
rollicking student crew, and he had soon passed from &#8220;Monsieur&#8221;
to surname, from surname to Christian name, translated to
heathen barbarianisms, to Noll, mon vieux, old man.... Dick
Davenant and the other Foolish Virgins came in for a like ovation
from &#8220;the boys.&#8221; And it was with some difficulty that they
managed to struggle through the genial riot after Betty and join
those that sat at Doome&#8217;s table. Quogge Myre and Aubrey took
advantage of the chance to join the party.</p>

<p>Babette held Betty&#8217;s hand now, and prattled happily. She
pointed out to Betty&#8217;s keen eyes the many beauties present, told
their histories with light touch, without malice and without exaggeration&mdash;just
the simple picturesque sketch. And always the
end was the same. Suzanne yonder, with the glorious hair like
copper, she was the companion of that artist&mdash;he would arrive&mdash;oh,
yes, the world would hear of him. Suzanne had been a model
at the studios&mdash;but the hours were long&mdash;it was very fatiguing&mdash;the
walls of the studio were grey and bare&mdash;she hated dull gowns&mdash;she
went to the Bal Bullier&mdash;the next morning the studio was
very grey&mdash;she was cross and sleepy&mdash;the students were surly&mdash;it&#8217;s
so stupid to stand and be drawn&mdash;stupid and tedious and tiresome&mdash;she
would go no more&mdash;at the caf√©s one can do as one likes&mdash;the
caf√©s were gay&mdash;she had found a bourgeois&mdash;he was dull,
but she had silk dresses instead of gowns of stuff&mdash;still, he was a
bore&mdash;so she left him and came back to the caf√©s&mdash;the students
were always gay&mdash;the caf√© always bright&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, yes, that was Mimi&mdash;she had been a dressmaker&mdash;she too
had gone to the Bal Bullier&mdash;and had become the companion of a
law student&mdash;it was hard to keep the pot boiling, but she had been
happy&mdash;then his five years of <i>quartier latin</i> were up, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
gone home again and married and become bourgeois and respectable&mdash;so
she came to the caf√©, where the students are always gay
and the lights are always bright, and she liked to wear silks and
fine linen.</p>

<p>Betty touched her arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Babette shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she will marry a tradesman,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She gave it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Babette kissed Betty&#8217;s serious face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou odd inquirer,&#8221; said she. &#8220;If you ask after that and
after that, why we grow old one day&mdash;and after that die&mdash;and
after that are buried&mdash;and after that, who cares?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, and stroked Betty&#8217;s hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, and that is Marcelle&mdash;she was apprentice to a sempstress&mdash;but
the work was hard, the hours long, oh so long, and the food
scarce and poor&mdash;and she has only once to live&mdash;and she has
Titian red hair&mdash;she, too, came to the caf√©s, where the students
are always gay and the lights are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter from the students.</p>

<p>Out of the riot the quavering voice of age rose in broken falsetto,
singing a snatch of song that was on the town in Betty&#8217;s childhood,
a soprano passage from an old Italian opera.</p>

<p>An old woman, with blear watery eyes, her tattered and rusty
old dress hanging in an untidy bunch about her shrunken body,
a few grey hairs straggling over her withered leaden face, was
singing in the full operatic manner. A strange pathetic sight.
So an old harpsichord sounds, awaking startled ghosts in some
old-world room at the rude touch of living hands.</p>

<p>The end of the broken song was received with loud laughter
from the students, who shrieked and coughed until the tears stood
in their eyes&mdash;they flung pence at the old woman&#8217;s feet. Women
were standing on tables, students were crowded in a ring about
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast danced with Victor Hugo, Margot, my pearl&mdash;show
us how!&#8221; cried a bearded cub from the schools.</p>

<p>She bowed&mdash;gathered up her seedy tattered skirts with something
of the old-world grand manner that went with the stately
crinoline, and, showing down-at-heel boots of the elastic-sided
variety that are called &#8220;jemimas,&#8221; her feet got shuffling to the
steps of an old dance of the quarter. In the sunken hollows of the
wan old face hovered the ghost of the set smile that dancers smile,
baring toothless gums&mdash;the lights flickered but feebly in her lamp
of life&mdash;she skipped the steps now right, now left, now back, now
forward, with the stiff travesty of old age&mdash;and set the tables in a
roar. A grotesque attempt at high-kicking brought down thunders
of applause. The sous showered upon the floor.</p>

<p>She picked up the scattered money with pathetic weary old
hands; bowed to the applause, and taking her way stiffly through
the caf√©, passed out into the night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>And to Betty it was as though the shadow of death had passed
amongst the revellers. Ay, even youth must come to that&mdash;the
mockery and ghost of its dead self.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is old Margot.&#8221; Babette touched Betty&#8217;s hand.
&#8220;She comes out so at night&mdash;it was here she had her triumphs
fifty years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>Babette shrugged:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is rich,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;she comes out so at night&mdash;but in
the day she is rich. She has a villa in the country. Oh, but yes
... Gaston Latour has seen it. Last year. Ah, she was so
droll&mdash;she had sung a love-song in the tenderest manner. Gaston
gave her a gold piece by mistake for silver. She was here the
next night&mdash;Gaston also. He told her. &#8220;Bien!&#8221; said old
Margot, and gave him her card.... He went by rail&mdash;the villa
was on a lake&mdash;charming. He knocked. A servant opened the
door. He was shown into a salon. Madame would come in a
moment. Madame Margot came. Ah, yes, said she, the twenty-franc
piece! She opened a cabinet and gave it to him. Gaston,
dumbfounded, thanked her, was retiring towards the door thanking
her, apologizing. She put her hand on his sleeve: &#8216;But,
monsieur has forgotten the franc!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old woman once lived with a student who came to great
fame, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. She turned suddenly and gazed
hard at Betty:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are tears in your eyes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What are you
thinking of, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty sighed, and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;The waste of women&mdash;the waste of women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That evening, Aubrey cast his evil eyes upon Moll Davenant.</p>

<p>He sat beside her, showered upon her the subtle flattery of his
whole attention, was soon in touch with her thwarted ambitions,
was sharing her dreams&mdash;and before the evening was out he had
set a hedge of confidences round about her that isolated her, with
him as sole companion, from the rest of her fellows. With all the
moods of her frail talents he was swiftly intimate; and, as he sat
leaning forward, his cheek on his hand, gazing intently at her,
where she lolled back at his side, his eyes took in every turn and
line of the strange pallid beauty of her hungry features. He put
off his outward conceit and interested her in herself&mdash;as he himself
was interested&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a loud shout.</p>

<p>A number of the students and their young women rose, and
each dragging a chair behind him along the floor, they formed into
line, and marched round the caf√©, singing a student song.</p>

<p>Thrice round the caf√©, and flinging down the chairs, they
streamed out into the street....</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>At the door Betty kissed Babette good-night; and it was at
this moment, as their party stood about, that Betty, taking Moll
Davenant&#8217;s arm, was accosted by Quogge Myre, who at once
assumed the tone towards her that he considered so fascinating
to women&mdash;a tone of chivalrous condescension. Betty fretted
under the attention of his repulsive eyes. She did not like the
man&mdash;his intent regard could not escape her. He was asking if
he might call upon her; and she was answering that she was
denying herself all social calls until she had finished a work on
which she was engaged, when he put out his hand familiarly and
with his fingers flipped the ends of the ruffle that she wore:</p>

<p>&#8220;You look nice and fresh,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Betty turned her back upon him. He always affected her like
filth; when he spoke it was as if filth could speak.</p>

<p>She slipped her hand through Molly&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Horace Malahide, who had watched the incident, laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Babette!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;ll see Noll and Betty and
Moll home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty drew Moll Davenant away as Aubrey put his heels together
and gave his bow like a dancing-master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Moll,&#8221; said she, and squeezing the girl&#8217;s arm, she added
in a laughing whisper&mdash;&#8220;and I&#8217;ll find Eustace to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>To her surprise there was no answering smile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Aubrey and Myre turned out into the night together, Aubrey
looked at the other out of the corner of his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very beautiful woman who&mdash;snubbed you&mdash;Myre,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Myre shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman should require winning,&#8221; he said. He licked his
puffy underlip sullenly.</p>

<p>They walked awhile in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that she&#8217;s Baddlesmere&#8217;s wife,&#8221; Aubrey said&mdash;&#8220;and
a prude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they all like their squeeze,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>They walked some way down the street.</p>

<p>Aubrey sighed; and after awhile he said absently:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never loved a consumptive woman yet. And I have
found one&mdash;it will be a strange emotional experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s consumptive, the faded lily, is she?&#8221; growled Myre.
Aubrey smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is beautiful,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and she has a hectic mind.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Widow Snacheur separates the Milk from Human
Kindness</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a large and shabby room on the ground floor of the court, a
dark blur in the gloom of the gathering dusk, crouched rather than
sat the widow Snacheur&mdash;<i>La b√™te noire</i>, the street urchins had it in
awed whisper, thrusting out mocking chins behind her back.</p>

<p>With hard old fingers she was smoothing out upon the bare
table the crumpled sheet of newspaper which she had just unfolded
from a package sent by a tradesman; the hawklike eyes
strained to read the print, but the fading daylight smudged the
page.</p>

<p>She drew her soiled black shawl more closely about her bent
shoulders:</p>

<p>She lifted up a reedy voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine!&#8221; she cried harshly.</p>

<p>A door opened, and there stepped through the opened way a
lean girl of fourteen, the drudge that is called maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame,&#8221; said Madelaine, or what was the half-starved
embodiment of Madelaine, her long bare arms thrust out through
her turned-up sleeves, her dingy black dress a world too short for
her and showing bare legs, her stockingless feet in down-at-heels
boots that had already served another owner.</p>

<p>The child held herself insolently. Indeed, the old woman
Snacheur had beaten her the night before, falling upon the slender
shoulders with a stout stick; and for the first time the girl had
flown at the brutality and struck back&mdash;the old woman shuffling
backwards into a corner of the room before the onslaught, retreating
in sullen surprise, wiping a long tingling nose with the
back of a sinewy hand as the pain sent the tears trickling down
the runnels of her withered cheeks. Through scowling evil eyes
she had realized that the harsh thrashings of these poor lean
shoulders were at an end&mdash;that the four years of grim domination
since she had taken this poor outcast child to be her drudge were
gone&mdash;and that whatever cruelty of starvation and neglect her
miserly wits might still impose upon her hungry years, the rod
had fallen from her gloating fingers and the blue weals upon the
poor thin shoulders were painted with the hellish brand of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
cruel hand for the last time. The child was springing up into
starved youth&mdash;nay, girlhood was almost gone&mdash;indeed, within
the gaunt body lurked some strange hint of womanhood, smiling
forth even from the starved body of this hireling thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame,&#8221; said Madelaine.</p>

<p>The brooding old woman came back out of the humiliating past:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are halfpence on the table,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;go and buy
milk&mdash;and see that the thieving beast gives you full measure&mdash;there
was no milk in the neck of the bottle last night&mdash;he is a scoundrel&mdash;unless
you drank it on the way and are yourself the thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madelaine shrugged her lean shoulders, and gathered up the
halfpence. As she left the room the old woman called after her:</p>

<p>&#8220;And see that you are back before the darkness&mdash;there will be
no light to show you to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the child had gone, the old woman arose and shuffled to
a cupboard. She listened to the girl fumbling at the latch of the
outer door&mdash;heard her depart&mdash;waited so until the brisk footsteps
died away into the traffic of the street. Searching in her skirts
for a bunch of keys, she glanced carefully round the darkening
room, opened the cupboard door, and took out an old tin canister.
She held the canister to the fading light of the high window, chose
an end of candle from some others, and carefully locked up the tin
in the cupboard again. She set the candle in a bottle and lit it.</p>

<p>Sitting down by the table again, she smoothed out the crumpled
newspaper.</p>

<p>It was said that the widow Snacheur was rich. She owned at
any rate the block in which she lived&mdash;from the ground floor she
herself occupied up to the top floor where Moll Davenant rendered
tribute to her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Betty crossed the twilit court and entered the deeper gloom
of the house, she found Madelaine, a lean shadow in the dusk,
fumbling with the latch on the outer door of the widow Snacheur&#8217;s
apartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mademoiselle the American at home, Madelaine?&#8221; she
asked the girl.</p>

<p>Madelaine left the door, walked out into the courtyard and
looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, there is a candle burning on the sixth floor,&#8221; she
called across the court. She came to Betty: &#8220;And there is a
shadow cast. Mademoiselle the American must be at home,&#8221; she
added; and got to fumbling with the latch of the door again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you unlock it, Madelaine?&#8221; Betty asked the girl.
&#8220;Shall I hold your bottle? Your hands will be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, madame, no&mdash;you are very kind. The widow
will not have the lock mended&mdash;so I have to tie it with string from
the inside&mdash;when I go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty stood on one side to let a young workman go by. He
was a pasty-faced slouching young fellow of powerful loose build;
he had come down the stair with curious stealthy step; and he
took off his hat clumsily as he passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>Madelaine laughed as the awkward youth slouched out into the
court:</p>

<p>&#8220;That dirty fool Hi√©ne wants to be my lover,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;he
pesters me&mdash;but I am not going to love workmen&mdash;I am going to
be driven in carriages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Madelaine&mdash;you must not say such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madelaine gave her good-night, laughter in her eyes, and with
the grace of coming womanhood took herself off airily towards
the city&#8217;s lights&mdash;a promise of lithe beauty in her walk for all
her bedraggled rags.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moll Davenant had heard Betty&#8217;s light step upon the stair; she
opened the door for her to enter as Betty reached the landing.
When she had shut it, the two girls embraced each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Moll&mdash;and sit on the bed; and we&#8217;ll gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll suffered herself to be led to the sommier, and they sat
down upon the snowy whiteness of it.</p>

<p>Moll was watching Betty&#8217;s face hungrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moll,&#8221; said Betty&mdash;&#8220;I have been to look for Eustace Lovegood&mdash;ah,
such a mean shabby little hotel it was, poor fellow! but
he was gone. The waiter said he went back to England yesterday&mdash;after
waiting restlessly about the place for a letter that did not
come.... I wish Eustace would spend a little money on himself
instead of giving it to every pitiful person that cries out to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>She slipped on to the floor, buried her face in Betty&#8217;s lap, and
sobbed miserably.</p>

<p>Betty stayed with her until far into the night&mdash;until the heart-rent
girl slept peacefully upon the white bed.</p>

<p>She covered the poor sleeping soul with her meagre blankets....</p>

<p>As she rose to leave, her glance fell on a new book which lay
beside the lamp. It was a volume of erotic verse. She opened
it and found an inscription on the fly-leaf from Aubrey.</p>

<p>Betty sighed&mdash;put the lamp low&mdash;and slipped on tip-toe from
the room.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>


<p>In the dusk that held the city the next evening, Betty tapped
at Moll&#8217;s door; and she thought she heard a sob for answer....
She listened awhile; but all was still. She rattled at the door
and called. Only silence.</p>

<p>Slowly she descended the stairs again.</p>

<p>At the bottom she came upon Madelaine, lean and cheery.
There was some talk.</p>

<p>She was just about to leave the girl when a man entered from out
the dusk of the court, passed them, and began to ascend the stair.</p>

<p>It was Aubrey.</p>

<p>She heard him climb flight after flight. He reached the top.
Her eyes were on Madelaine&#8217;s gossip, but her ears were listening
for only one sound.</p>

<p>A door opened and slammed.</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein is Some Worship of the Moon</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the national f√™te of the Republic&mdash;the Fourteenth of July.</p>

<p>All day, Paris had been a-rattle with tap of hammers. At
every street corner, baggy-trousered carpenters had been putting
the last nails into the pulpits of the lightly made bandstands; and
now, as the flaring sun went down in golden glory over the edge
of the city, bathing the decorated streets in amber light&mdash;the
boarding of the bandstands being covered with the gay splendour of
tricolour bunting, and gaudy coloured paper lanterns strung in gay
festoons from lamp and tree and window&mdash;Paris felt herself arrayed
in all her holiday attire as she took breath before her dancing.</p>

<p>At the end of the street where Noll and Betty had their lodging,
the carpenters completed their task amidst wide-eyed wonder of
inquisitive children and chatter of gossiping neighbours that stood
at gaze along the pavement. The landlord of the little restaurant
opposite called to the workmen to go and sit down at his tables
and quench their thirst. The great slouching fellows needed no
second bidding&mdash;indeed, they knew the liquor good, for the fat
genial little host, Monsieur Charcot, had been plying them with
tankards throughout the day, at every hint of heat or weariness,
and the hints had not been few, urging them to push on, that he
might get up his lanterns, and cover the stand with the red, white
and blue stripes of France before darkness fell.</p>

<p>Beaming with hospitality, he now sallied across the road, two
waiters at his side carrying paper lanterns and bundles of the
nation&#8217;s flags; and the rickety bandstand was soon converted
into as near a gorgeous opera-box as the limitations would allow.</p>

<p>Madame Charcot stood near, crying orders to the waiters, which
nobody obeyed.</p>

<p>All the pretty <i>blanchisseuses</i>, bare-headed, were out along the
curb, adding advice and merriment. The which brought out the
shop-lads. There was kindly genial banter, and much talk and
prophecy of dancing in the evening.</p>

<p>The old people stood about, smiling; and were raising reminiscences
from the dead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evening, Gaston Latour and Horace and the rest whooped
to Noll and Betty to come down from their high lodging; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a jovial party they wandered through the glowing streets of
the illuminated city. All Paris was dancing. Under the gaudy
paper lanterns the citizens were strolling, dancing, capering,
laughing, singing&mdash;happy as children. And when the students,
returning from their long evening&#8217;s promenading, came into the
street where they lived, the bray and blare and shrill music of
fiddle and trombone and cornet and flute, rending the rustling air
with an old-time waltz-tune, told that the quarter was still
dancing.</p>

<p>The youths and maids were dancing; the middle-aged were
dancing; shop-folk and artisan; the old people were dancing.</p>

<p>Mine host, Monsieur Charcot, kicked a heel, blowing hard to keep
the time with a young milliner to the pace of the ill-jigging waltz&mdash;the
trombone being overfull of beer was inclined to sluggardy,
whilst the fiddle had developed ambition under the heat of the
wines of Italy to lead the music by more than an easy length.
The trombone did well, doggedly thrashing the air with overwhelming
beat of time, save when he hiccupped, when confusion
would threaten. All the little sempstresses and washer-girls were
stepping it, swinging round in the whirl with the grocer lads and
the youths of the quarter, petticoats a-whirl. The pasty-faced
and sullen young workman Hi√©ne, in his best clothes, was jumping
through the measure with Madelaine, who had given old widow
Snacheur the slip. And now the melancholy-visaged Gaston
Latour seized the plump concierge about the height a waist had
once been, and Madame Hodendouche, but mildly protesting,
found herself flung off her feet and swept into the revolving whirl,
well-pleased enough to be in the social eddy....</p>

<p>All in the street danced out the night, the same tune serving
more than thrice&mdash;indeed, the call for new airs had started an unseemly
brawl between the fiddle and the trombone on the art of
Wagner, which had only been washed out in Chartreuse. So they
got to jigging it again to the old limping harmonies. They were
not over-critical. They had all grown up together, had danced
out the national f√™te together through the warm summer evening
in the ruddy glow of the orange-paper lanterns to the like halting
music since they could well remember. Thus they now footed it,
until the white light of the coming day crept over the eastern
roofs and snuffed out the orange glow of the candles that guttered
in the lanterns&#8217; sockets, and sent them all to their beds. The
early midsummer sun that came a-peeping into the town lit silent
thoroughfares in a drowsy city.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arisen sun ascending into the high firmament saw the
students thronging to the railway-stations, with scanty baggage
and uproarious souls, to spend the hot days in country places or
by the sea&mdash;a cheery boisterous crew, good-tempered, chaffing,
frankly jovial.</p>

<p>The exodus from the Latin Quarter begun, the &#8220;boys&#8221; burst
in upon Noll and Betty&mdash;Babette and Horace and the Disturber
of Funerals and the rest, and Gaston Latour. They all helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to pack, and dragged them off to join the mighty holiday stream,
going down to the outskirts of Paris, to Enghien-les-Bains and
Montmorency, by train, Gaston Latour rending the air with
devilish din of French horn, and insisting on dancing the Arab
<i>danse-de-ventre</i> before railway officials and the police, his melancholy
face seriously unsmiling as he stepped it, the others wailing
the mournful Moorish music and beating time with tap of canes or
beat of hands.... And all too fleetly the summer days went
by in the pretty country places round about Paris.</p>

<p>Betty loved this summer time. Noll was with her all the day
long, blithe of heart and in good spirits, sketching with her and a
dozen others out of doors or writing by her side in their delightfully
bare room in the primitive inn. The world was fragrant
with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>As the sunny daytime passed into the violet grey dusk, they
would wander arm in arm along the pretty country roads&mdash;Babette
and Horace, Noll and Betty, Gaston and the beautiful
Liane, the Five Foolish Virgins and the rest&mdash;straying through the
twilight carelessly, never wandering too far from civilization and
the band and the casino&#8217;s paper lanterns&mdash;never too far to reach
the merry dinner of an evening, lolling in pleasant fatigue round
the table in the trim little bosquets of the courtyards of inns,
where they all loitered over dinner to talk wondrous nonsense
about the delights of a country life, mixed with criticisms of art
and of books and of the world. And, the dinner done, they would
stroll round the lake, and sit upon the banks, and gaze entranced
at the moonlit fairyland&mdash;the lights that danced upon the waters
and the stars that bespangled the sapphire heavens with a myriad
winking mysteries&mdash;glad to be alive where all was beautiful.</p>

<p>And there would be sweet idle talk of the day when they should
all have villas on the lake with lawns by the water&#8217;s edge, disdainful
of the rough struggle of the world, watching the pigeons
and the peacocks in the sun, listening to the coo of doves, and,
when the day was done, content to sit at gaze with the wizard
moon and myriad stars, fretting their souls with no stupid thought
for fame or name&mdash;yet each one knowing in his heart that in most
delicious idleness would be weariness beyond the weariness of toil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was one thorn only in all this summer delight&mdash;Moll
Davenant, moody, a prey to odd whims, possessed now of strange
reservations and sudden shrinkings, now frightened, now daring,
now boisterous, now brooding, lived feverishly, crowding her life
into its little span, her pathetic eyes on her doom, as one who
knows how short a while she has to live. More than once, Betty
had sold some trinket of her own to get the wherewithal to tempt
the uncertain appetite; and Noll, too, was the poorer by more
than one little possession which he cheerily said he did not want.
Then the girl would disappear for days, returning fagged and
troubled, like one drugged. Her flushed colour showed that the
flames of her life were burning out the tissues of her frail body, and
a feverish desire to live the night as well as the day urged her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
frantic bursts of work and of excitement, alternating with long
hours of lassitude and a pathetic patience and humility and listless
idleness. One day she disappeared and was not heard of for a
week; then the news came from far away that she had been seen
at the casino at Dieppe with Aubrey.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>


<p>At the doors of the Hotel Continental in Paris stood Ponsonby
Wattles Ffolliott, talking to Quogge Myre; Rupert Greppel and
Lord Monty Askew stood at either hand; they gazed superciliously
at the passers-by.</p>

<p>Ponsonby Ffolliott, blowing cigarette smoke through his nostrils,
said, drawling:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful bore&mdash;but Lady Boone is throwing her girl at
my head&mdash;an awfully pretty girl, she is, by Jove&mdash;but, you know,
a fellow must have his fling first&mdash;or how is a fellow to know he
loves the girl&mdash;and I am really quite too young&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They slapped him on the back, and there was laughter.</p>

<p>Ponsonby Ffolliott felt the glory of a man of the world jumping
in his marrow; he kicked out his legs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said affectedly. &#8220;The old trout made me swear to
go down to Enghien-les-Bains for lunch. Such a silly hole&mdash;such
a silly meal&mdash;but, you know, a fellow isn&#8217;t bound by a promise
made under compulsion, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ponsonby blew out smoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said, staring at a girl, one of a bevy that passed,
who glanced a roguish eye at him&mdash;&#8220;what a very pretty girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ponsonby kicked out his legs jauntily; and followed the girl.
And, as he walked, the long white laces of his stays hung down
behind and swung to his strutting.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is suspected that there has been Peeping through
Windows</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">August</span> and September passed, and the fever went out of the hot
breath of the sun; October came into the city in cooler fashion
and more russet habit. The scent of autumn in the air brought
the students scrambling back from the country, and the Boule
Miche knew their light gait and cheery voice once more.</p>

<p>With the return of his boon companions to their old haunts,
Noll was out and away early and late again. The first day of
October had seen him taken off by Horace Malahide, with a set
of drawings to G√©r√¥me&mdash;had seen him receive the letter which
should admit him a <i>nouveau</i> to the great man&#8217;s <i>atelier</i> in the State
schools of the Beaux Arts. He had only to wait until the fifteenth
to be initiated into the riotous mysteries of the French studio
where Latour and Malahide were not the least boisterous of its
boisterous pupils.</p>

<p>As Noll came back, triumphant from his interview with the
celebrated painter, Horace and Latour singing him in, he flung
down his drawings upon the floor. Betty, glowing with delight at
his delight, took them up one by one, and was somewhat surprised
at their technical accomplishment. She had feared his days
with Horace Malahide had been but idle days. Yet, even with
this evidence before her eyes, she was not without shrinkings,
for she knew the feverish energy which Noll could put into any
effort to gain what he wanted for the time being&mdash;and she knew
he had greatly fretted to get into G√©r√¥me&#8217;s <i>atelier</i>.</p>

<p>Beyond?</p>

<p>She knew his Beyond had been of the vaguest. The jovial
comradeship of the schools had roused him to effort. And even
whilst she went up to him and embraced him, she wondered
whether his eyes had been fixed upon any Beyond. She glowed
to the pressure of his jovial embrace; she felt the delight of his
achievement&mdash;yet her clear-seeing eyes were afraid for him. He
was so easily successful.</p>

<p>They all sallied out together with Betty, roused the Five Foolish
Virgins (Moll Davenant&#8217;s door refused to open); and there was
cackle and riot as they took a restaurant by storm. The crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wine had never seemed so mellow, the mystic dishes had not
tasted finer at an emperor&#8217;s banquet&mdash;ah! the mysteries of the
cooking-pot never yield such savour as to the palate of youth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the fifteenth, a fresh October day,
Horace Malahide and Gaston Latour came for Noll; and he, in
mighty high spirits, an easel over his shoulder and a couple of
rush-bottomed stools dangling therefrom, hugged Betty and sallied
out with the others to face the wild horseplay that greets the
coming of the <i>nouveau</i> on the opening day in the art schools of Paris.</p>

<p>Betty, leaning over the balcony, kissed her hand to him as the
three, looking up, waved their hats, and departed out of the court.</p>

<p>She smiled as she thought of the devilments that would ensue;
and she smiled still more at the thought of Noll, returned from it
all, helping her on with her jacket and hurrying her off to dinner,
telling her of the amusing details in his rollicking humorous way,
with his quaint eye for the quips and oddities of droll situations.</p>

<p>But the day was heavy upon her&mdash;she could not bend her will
to her work&mdash;the hours passed with sullen tread....</p>

<p>As the sun set she began to listen for Noll&#8217;s footfall. The last
sunset glow of the eastern heavens passed into the grey twilight;
the chill breath of the evening warned her that her frequent
roamings to the balcony must cease; she shut the shutters and the
window. But the stairs echoed to no sound of Noll&#8217;s eager return.</p>

<p>It came to the girl for the first time&mdash;selfless as she was&mdash;that
Noll was finding the sufficient delights of life very well without
her; and the thought bit into her heart.</p>

<p>She sighed and arose wearily.</p>

<p>To-night she must dine alone, as she had so often dined alone
of late&mdash;yet to-night, for the first time, she resented it&mdash;was stung
by the whisper that it need not have been.</p>

<p>She took her way to the little street of l&#8217;Ancienne Com√©die.
She did not trespass into Noll&#8217;s noisier caf√©s&mdash;the noise and the
disturbance and restlessness distressed her. Noll preferred &#8220;life&#8221;
at the noisier caf√©s&mdash;the greetings were louder.</p>

<p>Betty betook herself languidly now to her dinner, through the
white portals of the Caf√© Procope. She stole into a quiet corner,
where she was used to sit and think her sweet thoughts, where the
pen was always busy. But her weary brain this night was
branded with harsh truths from which she could find no hiding-place.
She wondered what the great brooding brains that had
known this ancient hostel had gnawed upon within these very walls&mdash;what
petty little insolences had been thrust upon <i>them</i> whilst
they were &#8220;thinking in continents.&#8221; And she felt it a relief when
at last the old-world spirit of the place took possession of her, and
she found her wits roaming from herself through the pageant of its
past magnificence. The dark atmosphere of its sombre peacefulness
was lit for awhile with the glory of its ancient days; and the
dark corners of the Caf√© Procope became haunted with the mighty
breath of its Great Dead. These had been no mediocrities, whatever
their faults and failings, but big full-blooded Men&mdash;their very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
sins preposterously magnificent passports to Hell. These were
not content to play with the mere toys of life&mdash;juggling with
echoes.</p>

<p>Fallen into the faded relic of bygone days, this peaceful place
has passed into the quietude of the neglected thoroughfare on the
narrow footway of which stand its white portals. The strenuous
world goes rattling past the end of the old road, unheeding
of its one-time magnificence; turns but seldom into its neglected
way. Its noisy history is now forgot, its splendid drama remembered
by how few of them that live in all this vast splendid city&mdash;nay,
even by how few of such as have their dingy habitation in this
very street, or win the prizes of learning in the illustrious schools
of its neighbourhood!</p>

<p>Heretofore had been the very heart of all France&mdash;her hot blood
had leaped hottest here, sending the throb of its pulsing life to
uttermost valley and hamlet of this vast realm. In this little
coffee-house, now fallen into neglect, had met together the great
wits of France, her master-minds. Nay, rumour hath it that here
indeed was very name of coffee-house begotten, begun, made
manifest; for here was first given, to France, coffee to chase the
dinner and to comfort the stomach of France.</p>

<p>Hither wandering, our Orange William being just come to the
throne of England, there had entered into possession, in curly long
peruke and somewhat dandified exterior to his shrewd inner man,
Master Fran√ßois Procope, in that same year that the Comedy of
France took possession of the then Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais over the way;
and, forthwith, glory and fame came to his Caf√© Procope&mdash;the wits
gathering there to the sipping of coffee and making of elaborate
waggeries, not without wrangle, and swords whipped from sullen
scabbards, and the like follies manifold. Here had descended from
sedan-chair the bent lean figure of Voltaire, his play <i>Irene</i> being
in rehearsal opposite, and sipped the cup of coffee that was now
become the mode in France, the maker of mode. The keen eyes
had roved over these panelled walls&mdash;here he had stood sneering
away the tawdry pretence of popes and kings and laughing to
death the diseased and putrid hereditary aristocracy of France.
These walls knew the lean mocker well. In yonder sombre little
room you shall see still the chair and table at which he was used
to sit and write his vitriol jibes, that were the severe medicine for
the corrupt body of the decayed nobility.</p>

<p>Here, in fantastic riot, had Rousseau been carried shoulder high
after a dramatic triumph; here had Condorcet, in intervals of
writing upon the Integral Calculus, been not above horseplay;
here had sat Diderot, scheming his encyclop√¶dic schemes, talking
tomfool solemn travesties of dangerous talk with winking eye
upon his fellow-wags, to lead on the over-zealous police agents to
the fussy discovery of large mares&#8217; nests of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Nor had jests and badinage been the only fare. In these
ghostly dingy mirrors had passed the faces of the great actors in
the world tragedy of France. Within these walls had intrigued
the master conspirators of the seventeen hundreds. Here had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
been put on the first bonnet rouge that was symbol of the coming
earthquake of Europe. Here had sat, in yonder corner, fearless,
massive great-souled Danton, shock-headed, black haired, playing
at chess with the crooked blear-eyed horse-doctor Marat; here
had stood, dark-browed, pock-marked, incontinent, bankrupt, the
great resolute sane strong man of the Revolution, Mirabeau, the
born ruler of men, destined to die of his youth&#8217;s vices at that very
moment when bewildered France was at his feet and had the
sorest need of him; here, too, that other pock-pitted fellow, the
dandified sphinx of the madness, &#8220;seagreen&#8221; Robespierre, crafty,
merciless; here had throbbed the heart of Camille Desmoulins,
who lost his head in plea for mercifulness, bearding the bloody
madness of the Terror with proposal for a Committee of Mercy
that keeps his memory sweet as the mellow syllables of his name
to all eternity&mdash;here with d&#8217;Holbach he had sat or paced, airing
hot enthusiasms, plunging deeper into dangers their clean souls
scarce realized&mdash;moving forward to high dramatic destinies none
could foretell, godlike, to the guillotine and betrayal and death
and broken illusions. Here, too, forger, thief, and liar, had stood
H√©bert, one of the foullest blots on the Revolution, stood at that
door upon that table of Voltaire&#8217;s, and, mouthing his Sacred
Right of Insurrection, harangued the fierce crowd that packed the
narrow thoroughfare, exciting them to the black brutalities of the
Terror, stamping his great vulgar foot in passionate frenzy of
murderous blasphemies upon the table top so that the heel of his
heavy boot split the marble across&mdash;he who most damnably lied
away the fame of the poor doomed foolish queen where she stood
at trial alone amongst her hellish enemies&mdash;he who &#8220;hated the
word Mercy&#8221;&mdash;here he had sat, little dreaming that his filthy neck
should be slit in agony of craven appeal by the very laws of his
own planning.</p>

<p>Nay, within these very walls had been conspiracy within conspiracy&mdash;massacres
planned&mdash;the killing beginning at these
demure white doors.</p>

<p>Here, on that August day that the Monarchy fell, had sat
Madame Roland and Lucille Desmoulins, the sweet and beautiful
and rich mate of famed Camille, together with Madame Danton,
their ears athrob with ringing of bells and roar of cannon&mdash;the
shadow of the guillotine not flung as yet their way, unsuspected,
their eyes as yet not seeing, their white necks not feeling, that
harsh doom either for themselves or their lords.</p>

<p>Hence one day a genial, dreamy, kindly young officer of artillery
they called Napoleon Buonaparte, that lived at a small lodging in
a street hard by, walked out bare-headed, leaving his cocked hat as
security for his reckoning, having forgotten his purse. Here, in
days not so long past, Gambetta fumed and raved and swore and
dreamed and spouted, holding the Republic together as best he
could, a Republic broken with a dozen warring internecine strifes
and petty interests.</p>

<p>Here, the old caf√© having fallen on more peaceful days and slow
decay in its neglected thoroughfare, the poor dirty shabby genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that was called Paul Verlaine sat at the dead Voltaire&#8217;s table, and
wrote on scraps of paper his now world-famous lyrics.</p>

<p>The greatest of these had been mighty workers, men of iron toil.
These had not been content to thrum little five-fingered echoes of
the great music of the drama of life&mdash;these had created their own
music, their own methods, their own art. No man shall come to
greatness through juggling with echoes. These had made their
own style to express themselves&mdash;had no need of the elaborate
polishing of the tricks and ornaments of the mediocrities who,
having nothing to express, filch little movements and sounds from
the vasty music of the masters to cover their own little insignificance&mdash;who
in toil to polish phrases miss the statement. Nay,
these men had not been content with praise of mediocrities&mdash;had
scorned even their approval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, an hour before midnight, Betty, going homewards, passed
the house where Moll Davenant lived, she became aware of hoarse
whispers; looking up the dark side street as she crossed the road,
she saw a man standing on another&#8217;s shoulder peering into the
lighted room within&mdash;the widow Snacheur&#8217;s room. The fellow
leaped down, and the pair of them calmly sauntered down the alley.</p>

<p>Betty hurried on, vaguely wondering. She reached the house
where she lodged, and found the great gates shut. It came to her
that it was the first time she had felt a certain shrinking from ringing
the bell in the concierge&#8217;s den&mdash;the first time she had felt alone;
the first time she had tried to find an excuse for being alone.</p>

<p>She rang&mdash;the postern opened with a clank&mdash;she stepped in,
shut it, called her name as she passed the concierge&#8217;s window, and
climbed her stairs wearily.</p>

<p>It was very late, yet she had no fear that Noll had returned to
find no welcome.</p>

<p>She laughed sadly.</p>

<p>It dawned upon her that it was she who had always returned
unwelcomed to the empty hearth. He was probably leading the
laugh at some fantastic tavern&#8217;s good-fellowship....</p>

<p>As she let herself into her room, her glance fell on a note that
had been slipped under the door. She picked it up, lit her lamp,
and opened the letter listlessly: it was from the Disturber of
Funerals&mdash;her heart warmed to the genial handwriting, at the
thought of the big-hearted kindly man. As she read, her own
loneliness fell from her, her own affairs as usual became as naught.
Her eyes grew serious. Dick Davenant was off to America, recalled
by his people on urgent summons; he would catch the
Atlantic liner from England&mdash;would Betty, like the good comrade
she was, watch over Molly until he returned&mdash;she was grown full
of strange moods and kept him from her&mdash;he was at a loss....</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to her at daybreak,&#8221; Betty said; and languidly she
undressed.</p>

<p>She lay down on her bed; and the pillow that had known so
many bright dreams, ambitions, hopes, was for the first time wet
with Betty&#8217;s scalding tears.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LVII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which treats of what chanced at the Tavern of</i> The Scarlet Jackass</p>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> Noll?</p>

<p>It was close on midnight. In the smoke-laden air that made a blue
haze within the quaint tavern of <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i>, up and down the
narrow gangway between the crowded tables paced restlessly the
nervous figure of its artist-landlord, Andr√© Joyeux.</p>

<p>He wheeled round, and flung a phrase at the room; and a loud
burst of laughter greeted the sally.</p>

<p>At the tables, smoking, chatting, their glasses of milky absinthe and
tankards of ale before them, sat journalists, artists, poets, poetesses,
students, bohemians, women, musicians, and a soldier or so.</p>

<p>At one table was a group of students from G√©r√¥me&#8217;s <i>atelier</i>, with
Horace Malahide, Gaston Latour, Noll.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, as they dined, Andr√© Joyeux became
possessed of all the latest news of the town&mdash;political moves, social
happenings, scandals, theatrical gossip, literary events, before these
things were yet in print, often before they were written; and as he
now walked up and down, haranguing, he made his satiric comments
upon it all.</p>

<p>He smiled at the roar of laughter and applause. As he turned on
his heel at the end of the room, his glance fell on a wizened little old
man in gold-rimmed spectacles, who sat bent, and huddled, and
drowsing, his arms folded on the table before a glass of absinthe, a
wreath of white roses with which he had been crowned earlier in the
evening pulled slanting over one sleepy eye.</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux stopped in his stride:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, poet!&#8221; cried he, with a laugh, &#8220;thy wreath is awry.&#8221; He
clapped it on the back of the old man&#8217;s head. &#8220;What, thou sleepest
on the very steps of the altar of Fame! Thy brains are drowsy with
the fumes of the incense in the very temple of Wit; so Genius,
hiccupping with wine, misses his footing at the very threshold of
Immortality!... Tsha!&#8221; He turned on his heels and continued
his walk, striding down the room again. &#8220;Sleep if thou must&mdash;thou
canst read during to-morrow, twenty-four hours late, and at thy
leisure on the boulevards with the pot-bellied trader, the world&#8217;s news
that will be stale here with the snuffing of to-night&#8217;s candles; and
thou wilt get thy news, too, devoid of wit, without colour, stale and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
dull and flat as long-drawn small-beer, and twisted and distorted and
debauched to the uses of each journal.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the vague eyes of the little old mad poet had closed, and he
was nodding over his glass. Andr√© Joyeux laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our old singer of tuneless songs comes from the Latin Quarter,
across the river, comrades,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;he has the drowsy habits of
the academies&mdash;it is always so over there&mdash;on the flats across the
river, with their vaunted universities and isms and ologies. The
professors with dandruff on collar, and the students with talk of new
ideas and of the new generation, what do they know of life?&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung out his arm as he strode to and fro:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush! they have books down there, ridiculous printed things to
<i>tell</i> them of life! to tell them what other people think of life!...
They have museums, dry holes where bits of the dead past are stored
in glass cases. They have talk of architecture that is dead and useless
architecture&mdash;schools are endowed to teach it&mdash;nay, schools are
endowed to tell of what it used to be.... They hang up armour,
and write books about it&mdash;about armour!&#8221; He laughed loud and long.
&#8220;They might as well write about cooking-pots and discarded tin cans
with holes in them.... They will.... They talk of relics of the
past&mdash;nay, they worship them&mdash;build churches to them. They collect
things&mdash;coins, postage-stamps, what-not. They will collect spittoons
next. They form societies&mdash;learned societies to pester each other with
things that do not matter. They peer at old pictures that have lost
their vital significance, completed their function&mdash;build public galleries
for them, each room a nightmare of incongruous warring canvases, lost
to their original intention over a church&#8217;s altar or what not, wrangling
together, inadequate, foreign, out of place. As though by the looking
upon Cromwell&#8217;s bones or Napoleon&#8217;s breeches they would learn to rule
the world! Students pay to see these things&mdash;spend the precious years of
youth poring over them, even copying them! The delirious years of
youth!... They call it culture. Gods! culture!... To the Latin
Quarter, to the professors, dandruff-collared, to the gaping student, life
is this dusty dull study of what is dusty and dull and stupid and dead....
We of the Hill of Martyrs, it is we who know what is life. Stand
at your doors in our steep streets, climb you up yonder to the top of
the hill, up with you to the topmost scaffolding of the preposterous
cathedral of the Sacred Heart that is a-building, topped with cupolas
that shall stand like giant onions to acclaim the sins of garlic-eating
burgess France, and look down&mdash;condescend to Paris. Between us
and the river, with Latin Quarter beyond, glitter the lights of a different
Paris, another world&mdash;a Paris that knows as little of us of the hill as
of the professors of the Latin Quarter yonder&mdash;a Paris of the boulevards,
a Paris of the aristocrat and of the burgess&mdash;a world that knows little
of poetry or of learning, and tries to forget what it knows; a world
that despises us as we despise it; that shuns us as we shun it. There
the burgess, with sole ambition the desire to best his neighbour, plods
in glum respectability his mean inglorious day, yet once in a blue
moon struts his holiday, his limbs cramped with lack of use to live,
his only law of life a fear of his neighbour&#8217;s opinion, his object in life
to put a number of coins in a bank, to grow full-bodied in the doing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
marry a wife and reproduce his ignoble species. His furthest ambition
to grow very old. God! what a life! Yet is his end like ours who live
one long holiday&mdash;to die and rot like any lousy beggar, or prince, or
cardinal. For the avoidance of this his bank cannot serve&mdash;he can
write no letter of credit that shall avail him beyond his length of earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, Andr√©&mdash;they exist; they do not live,&#8221; cried a young fellow of
pallid countenance, whose hand, thin, and white, and delicate as a
woman&#8217;s, shook as he raised his glass of absinthe to his lips.</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux laughed in his stride:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, comrades,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;it is we on the Hill of Martyrs who
<i>live</i>.... Climb Montmartre, and you are in a rare atmosphere&mdash;get
you up amongst the scaffolding a-top of it, and you may touch the
clouds&mdash;the air is light, vivacious, exciting as wine&mdash;solemn things
and dull talk fall away from you&mdash;you must stoop if you would kiss the
hand to Paris, stoop to hail her, stoop to see her. Here we condescend
to the world. We are amongst the clouds&mdash;breathe the air the gods
have breathed. We have here no rare inclinations to riot&mdash;here <i>life</i> is
a riot. Down there they toil and moil all day through, all the months,
to snatch infrequent glimpses of life, that they have not the habit to
enjoy. Tush!&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;They call it a <i>holiday</i>! Ho, Ho, Ho!
a holiday!... They lie down at the ticking of a clock&mdash;sleep at the
bidding of their task-masters&mdash;awake at the striking of a clock to work
their fingers to the bone for a shabby grave. Worse still, work others&#8217;
fingers to the bone, even the fingers of woman and child, this pitiful
scourged crew, to make rich the brutish vulgarians whom they so
fantastically serve. God! what a hell&#8217;s stew!... With the darkness
they lie down and go to sleep&mdash;to awake with the daylight to further
toil and moil again. A Russian grand-duke steals their prettiest
daughter for a week or more, then takes another. The rich, who are
their idols, misuse their beautiful women; so they look up to the
rich.... But we! we live all the while. If we&#8217;ve a mind to it, we
rejoice in the night&mdash;we sleep when we will&mdash;live whilst we may.
Life&#8217;s but for a few flitting years at best. These others are so mad
they think us mad who know them mad.... If we are mad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped a waiter who passed with a tray of tumblers filled with
absinthe. His hand shook so that he spilled some liquor as he raised
a glass:</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are mad, then here&#8217;s to madness!&#8221;</p>

<p>They roared with laughter, banged their fists upon the board, raised
their glasses and drank with him. He emptied the glass and flung it
to a waiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If theirs be sanity to huddle in foul dens, feed on the Mad Cow of
Hunger, scowl sullenly at life from work-stunned eyes, all to fill the
purse of pot-bellied tradesmen, to build with their blood and toil
the vulgar habitations of their pretentious vulgarity, then &#8217;twere better
to be mad.... And no worse than Sanity.... We too have tasted
the flesh of the Mad Cow, but we have not sold our souls for bread,
nor our lives to be allowed to rummage on a dunghill.&#8221; He held out
his hands and grasped the air, adding with hoarse passion: &#8220;We live,
I say&mdash;we live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood proudly, and gazed at the applause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>They called to him to sing; and he stood there and sang the song that
held Paris; and as he sang the refrain, they all burst into the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Proud as kings and loud as carters,</div>
<div class="verse">Live we who live on the Hill of Martyrs.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the rousing chorus was done, amidst thunders of applause,
fists banged upon the tables, Andr√© Joyeux mounted a chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our exquisite singer and friend, Adolphe St. Pierre, is unable to
keep his engagement to-night,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But our ancient friend,
Paul de Gattepo√©sie, will take his place,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>There was ironic applause.</p>

<p>The old man with wreath of roses on his head, rousing from his
stupor at the nudgings of those that sat near, arose from his chair and,
with a smile, shuffled towards the piano. He took his place in serious
conceit as the player ran through the refrain of a lilt, and, in a broken
voice, he began to utter the verse of his song. But he forgot the
words, and the piano finished without him. There was a titter. His
vague eyes lighted up again and he started to utter another mood, and
again the piano finished without him. And thus, standing there, his
straying wits roamed through the maze of the bewildering land of the
mad&mdash;inconsequently, unabashed, pathetic, unashamed.... He had
loved a maid that was red&mdash;and swore his allegiance&mdash;and she was
very beautiful&mdash;but somehow he came to love a maid that was white&mdash;but
she had a mother&mdash;and the maid that was red did not like it&mdash;so
she drowned herself in the lake, a clammy, forbidding, ill-smelling lake&mdash;but
it was the mother that, somehow, made him love a girl that was
dark&mdash;but she had a brother&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the magistrate asked him
why he drank strong drinks&mdash;but he said he had but drunk the milk
of the Mad Cow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The rose garland slipped forward and came down over his eyes,
when in the midst of the buffooning laughter that greeted the accident
the doors of the tavern were flung open and several Salvation Army
girls entered the room.</p>

<p>The old mad poet blinked at the interruption, sighed, and shuffled
back to his seat and his absinthe.</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux rose and went forward to greet the Salvation lasses,
received them gently, and asked them if they would sing. One of the
girls nodded, ran a few notes on a droning concertina, a tambourine
was struck and chinked, and the Salvation Army lass raised her voice
in song&mdash;the strange sound of an English hymn sung in French with
rough true notes, and with passionate eagerness declaring the glory of
God and the gentleness of the Christ in this fantastic place of worn-out
moods and critical art-sense. At the next verse the chant was
taken up by the other women, to the threat of hell-fire, the dread of
judgment, the fierce revelling in the blood of Christ, the promise of
eternal life amidst the glory of the angels; the girls&#8217; voices gave out a
last hoarse shout of praise, and the tavern rang with the riot of
applause. Andr√© Joyeux went and thanked them prettily.</p>

<p>When the girls had trooped out of the place he watched the door
close upon them:</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;what enthusiasm!... It is very dramatic.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>The company rose to go, giving Andr√© good-night as they went out,
and, it being near midnight, Noll and Horace, and the others with
them from G√©r√¥me&#8217;s <i>atelier</i>, were about to go also and leave the
regular frequenters of the place to their intimate gossip in the closed
tavern, when Andr√© came down to them and asked them to stay. He
took them round and showed a sketch of Noll&#8217;s framed amongst the
many works of celebrities that hung upon the walls. &#8220;My friend, you
are an artist,&#8221; said he.... They went and sat down at Andr√©&#8217;s
table. The others all moved up about them. There was more beer,
more absinthe. &#8220;The tavern is now closed,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you are
my guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk became more intimate.</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux would rise from his seat between the rallies, restlessly
pacing the half-empty room, gesticulating, laughing, frowning, droll&mdash;bending
his whole wits to the point at issue. His trenchant mind took
on a lighter humour. Whatever topic came up, when he felt about it
and did not let it pass him with uncaring eyes, he would get up from his
seat and get to pacing the room again, playing with it, extolling or condemning,
criticising, turning it over and inside out, his keen wit tearing
it to shreds or weaving for it a wreath of bays&mdash;ever and anon moistening
his throat, tilting his glass of absinthe in his shapely white hands.</p>

<p>An hour after midnight he was more than exhausted.</p>

<p>He called for supper....</p>

<p>He drank; none deeper. His talk was wild, his quick tongue and
nimble brain were matched against some of the keenest wits of Paris,
and his sharp satiric rallies, his rollicking and fantastic humour, never
showed to greater advantage than on that night....</p>

<p>Some young fellow asked why Adolphe St. Pierre had not sung this
night; it was a somewhat unhappy query, and Andr√© Joyeux&#8217;s quick
ears caught it. It set him brooding; the laughter went out of his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;His nerves have gone,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;this morning at daybreak he
became violent&mdash;dangerous&mdash;about the double genitive.&#8221; He smiled
sadly. &#8220;It took four poets and a journalist to hold him down, and a
musician to pluck at the locked door and wring his hands and say how
dreadful it was.... Poor Adolphe! he is gone quite mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pale youth touched Andr√© Joyeux on the sleeve with trembling
fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;your life is a furnace, burning night and day&mdash;you,
too, will go mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed a rough laugh, boisterously unmirthful; raised his
glass; tossed it off:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what they used to say to Rodolph Salis,&#8221; said he hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;that
is what they used to say to Rodolph Salis.... Ah, that
was a man. He knew how to live....&#8221; He got up, his hands
twitching, and paced the room again: &#8220;It was Rodolph Salis that
brought <i>the wits</i> to Montmartre. It was Rodolph Salis who saw that
Genius would condescend to roar at the tavern, not to snore at the
academy&mdash;it was Rodolph Salis who saw that as artist he could only
be one of many, but as tavern-keeper he might be immortal&mdash;so it
came that Rodolph created the most renowned tavern of France&mdash;so it
came that Rodolph Salis opened the tavern of <i>The Black Cat</i>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to its artistic rooms, in the atmosphere of masterpieces hung on the
walls round about amongst its old dark panelling, under the dim lights
of its wrought-iron lamps, the wits fore-gathered to godlike entertainment.
On those walls the pencil of Steinlen had traced a masterpiece,
and Willette&#8217;s dainty fingers drawn the nervous laughing line; there,
seated before his glass of absinthe, I have seen Paul Verlaine write
the exquisite lyrics of France; there, among the splendid riot, have sat
Daudet, and Zola, and Richepin, Meissonier and Puvis de Chavannes
and the rest.... Hoho! Salis put his waiters into the livery of the
Forty Immortals, green coats and green leaves and breeches and silk
stockings and all&mdash;put his flunkies into the habit of them that drowse
at the Academy down yonder across the river, each snoring in his
seat, the fortieth part of Immortality, sleeping away the honour of
France, between bouts of cudgelling their dullard wits to produce
the printed book. Tshah! where are the Immortals, the gods?
Outside. Outside and aloof they stand&mdash;Moli√®re and Rabelais and
Balzac, Diderot and Rousseau, Victor Hugo and Georges Sand, Montaigne
and De Musset, Zola and Verlaine, Daudet and Flaubert and
Baudelaire and Th√©ophile Gautier.... And whilst the Fortieth parts of
Immortality each slept, smugly overfilling his breeches&#8217; girth, loading
the Academy with dull breathing, Rodolph Salis called the wits together:
and at his call the immortals flung the immortal phrase round about the
board, tossed to and fro the splendid jest in his tavern of <i>The Black Cat</i>.
Day and night, spontaneous, full-blooded, polished, they lived their scintillating
life.... I can see Rodolph, orange-haired, orange-bearded,
pale, green-eyed, his wondrous white hands restless with the leaping
pulse and quick nerve, as he was wont to sit at dinner with the wits. <i>There</i>
was the real Academy of France. Ay, his waiters most fitly wore the
leafed green coats and breeches of the Fortieth part of Immortality!...
Ah, how the wine glowed!... With the dessert, Rodolph, sipping
his coffee, listened with furrowed brow to the latest news, weighing it,
testing it&mdash;the most brilliant journalists of France at his elbow. The
quips, the jests, the biting comment! It was the centre of the world!...
I can hear their literary criticism destroy a life&#8217;s work in a <i>mot</i>, fling
immortal honour in a phrase, tossed in epigram across the table, and
back again another as keen-edged&mdash;the last gossip of the stage&mdash;the
loud hilarious scandal.... I can see Rodolph, the brows wrinkled
in mighty furrows of keen attention as the poets read their lines&mdash;can
hear his bravas that made men rich and set their blood tingling&mdash;can
pluck out of the dead years the condemning thunders of his dispraise,
can catch his deft wit polishing a blundering line.... But for
Rodolph Salis many a poet, singer, artist had been this day in his
garret, unknown&mdash;trudging, down at heels, the Undiscovered Country.
But the artist in him! never forgetting his magnificence that he kept
the tavern of France.... Hoho! I can hear the jovial laugh:
&#8216;My lords,&#8217; he&#8217;d cry, &#8216;the time has come for the nobility and self-respecting
gentlemen to demand a fresh tankard of ale.&#8217; Hoho! that
was a king of tavern lords! Then the golden ale went round&mdash;the
cloudy absinthe.... And when the room began to fill and the time
for shadow-shows to begin, Salis was in full stride. Affable to his
guests, always the good host, well-bred, polished, good-humoured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
giving the stranger rank of nobility, he would show &#8216;monseigneur&#8217;
with pride of possession the cats that were limned upon the walls, the
sketches, the glories of his ancient place; and lead the way to the
shadow-show upstairs, sketches of France&#8217;s genius on the stair&#8217;s walls,
hanging everywhere&mdash;and he so proud of it all! I can see him
stride up and down the passage of the shadow theatre up there, as the
witty pictures fell in black silhouette across the white sheet of the
theatre&#8217;s round proscenium, his gay laugh, his running whimsical
comment on affairs, his fierce biting denunciations, the flashing green
eyes, the nervous white hand&mdash;God! what a fire burned there!...
Ah, what songs, what poesie, what rhapsodies, what quaintly spoken
words have sounded within those walls!... At midnight when the
crowd was gone, as we sit here to-night, he was alone with the wits
again&mdash;and the wine glowed, and the cloudy absinthe went round&mdash;and
there was supper that the gods had envied to the tune of the wild
badinage that was tossed about the board. And he, Rodolph Salis,
the brightest star!... How the ghosts of the Great Dead have
arisen at our summons, and walked there!... Tshah! <i>there</i> was
the Academy of the world.... But&mdash;he&mdash;one day&mdash;found his nerves
were gone&mdash;he took to his bed.... Even amidst the rousing chorus
in the wind that passed, his quick ears had heard the Old Reaper&#8217;s
whetstone upon the sickle&mdash;he heard the whisper of Doom&mdash;and the
nimble wit of Rodolph Salis had never missed the intention of the
most subtle hint. He tossed his jibe to Death. And who with more
weighty right to the insolence? He had known life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux ceased speaking; stood brooding; roused; striding
to his place, he raised a glass&mdash;his hand shook&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The room was deathly still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodolph Salis knew life,&#8221; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>There was silence whilst he drank; and again he got to his restless
pacing:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one man in all this wide world,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who was
glad when the sign of <i>The Black Cat</i> was taken down&mdash;that man was
Rodolph&#8217;s brother, Gabriel Salis. They had been estranged from the
time of Gabriel&#8217;s setting up this tavern of <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i>, hating
each other&#8217;s successes, jealous that the same mother had endowed
them with equal wit, resentful of each other&#8217;s magnificence....&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode up and down several times in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rodolph being dead,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;Gabriel reigned in his
stead.... Here within these walls his wit flashed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swept his arm proudly round the room and strode off again:</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;because his hand shook&mdash;and&mdash;his tongue wagged feverishly,
speaking the fantastic thinkings of that teeming imagination, they
cried out that he, too, would go mad; and he, raising his glass as
Rodolph had done in trembling fingers, would laugh boisterously....
But&mdash;Gabriel, too, heard the whisper&mdash;he feared to die the death that
Rodolph died&mdash;and the tavern of <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i> passed to Andr√©
Joyeux.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed, wheeled round, and swept his hand towards the flaring
poster at the end of the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;There have I drawn Gabriel on his scarlet jackass, bags of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
about him, trotting away to the fresh air of the fields to the country
house he had bought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved down the room again, moodily:</p>

<p>&#8220;But he, too, took to his bed&mdash;he had lived his life&mdash;he missed his
glass, his fellows, the rousing chorus, the jovial good fellowship. He
was bored. He took to his bed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr√© Joyeux paced in moody silence a couple of turns up and
down the room, went to his place, raised a glass and drained it to the
dregs:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now the wits feast with me.... Steinlen, and thou, Toulouse
Lautrec! ye drink in Joyeux&#8217;s tavern. And thou, Willette! though
thou didst draw that red ass there in likeness of Rodolph Salis,
because thou hadst thy quarrel with him&mdash;thou at least quarrelled
with a man.... God! I have drunk wine here with Paul Verlaine,
first lyric poet of France. Ay,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;why poor Rodolph? why
poor Gabriel? why poor St. Pierre?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he added hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you these men were not afraid to live. They were men.
They were not&mdash;afraid&mdash;to&mdash;live....&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the smoky twilight that goes before the dawn, as the purple night
moved westward over the city, sweeping the world with dusky train,
the door-keeper in fantastic livery, his cocked hat on the back of
his head, yawned, as beadles yawn at sermon-time, and unlocked the
door of the tavern that is called <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i>, to let the revellers
pass out into the street, Noll and the young students along with them.</p>

<p>They stood on the pavement in the chill air to make an end of their
last gossip before parting on their separate ways.</p>

<p>Several were giddy with the haze of their potations, and, having
lurched out into the open world, more than one stood with difficulty,
though none were wanting in the desire for dignity.</p>

<p>All night long, Noll and Horace Malahide had been stealthily exchanging
their full glasses for the emptied glasses of beer-soaking
bohemians; but, even so, the fumes of the place were in their brains,
and the fresh air made them both for a moment light-headed. The
old bibbers of the place, stupid and smoke-stained, and sphinx-like in
reserve, stepped out of the tavern cautiously, pale, weary, and nerveless.
As the old poet, with his wreath of wilted white roses, lurched
out into the night, the door-keeper shut and locked the door from
within. The old man tripped over his own feet, stumbled, and sat
down suddenly on the footpath, whence he bade them all good-night
repeatedly, and fervently recommended them to the care of God.</p>

<p>The pale youth, holding Noll&#8217;s arm, which he had seized, said, with
a hiccup:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu, what a night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said the frequenters, shivering with the cold, and drawing
their thin cloaks about them&mdash;&#8220;what a night!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pale youth burst into tears, and made as though to fling his
arms round Noll&#8217;s neck, but missed his calculation, and fell over
the wreath-crowned old Gattepo√©sie. He tried to pick himself up;
and, as he stood on all fours, he said, with a hiccup:</p>

<p>&#8220;He will go mad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said an old bohemian&mdash;&#8220;they knew how to live&mdash;they
knew how to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said they&mdash;&#8220;they knew how to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bell rang and clinked and swung, hoarsely complaining, over
the bed in the little dark den of the concierge; and Madame
Hodendouche, rousing sulkily, sat up amongst her bedclothes and pulled
the string viciously that drew the bolt of the postern in the great gate
outside, muttering a snuffling curse on the lateness of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ring&mdash;ring&mdash;ring, thou pestilence!&#8221; she scolded savagely.</p>

<p>The gate outside shut with a slam, feet tramped past, a voice called,
and all was silence again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hodendouche,&#8221; she said sulkily to her snoring bedfellow&mdash;&#8220;the
Englishman does not give madame too much of his company in these
days&mdash;I had thought them lovers, but they are indeed married. He
is ever more late now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She settled her fat little body down amongst the bedclothes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thou mayest well snore, Hodendouche, thou lazy hog&mdash;but I
kept the Englishman ringing till he broke even thy sleep, and a good
cooling will do the fine fellow no ill. He has rung off and on this
good half-hour&mdash;I only fear he may have taken some varnish off the
gate with his pestiferous kickings and knockings....&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the smoky twilight Noll softly entered the shadows of the room,
and as he gently closed the door, he heard Betty toss restlessly in
troubled sleep.</p>

<p>He went and sat down upon the side of the bed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, taking her hand, &#8220;can&#8217;t you sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew his hand into the warm bed, and folded it under her warm
fingers against her breast:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had a happy day, Noll?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Noll yawned&mdash;he was very weary....</p>

<p>All day he had forgotten Betty; he was now so occupied with his
own weariness that he dully failed to see there was one in his life who
was selflessly eager to hear of his doings. As he unlaced his boots
and undressed, he told her baldly of his day&#8217;s adventures, but he
scarcely troubled to recall the events&mdash;he was very sleepy, he said.
Indeed, he had been shining all day, and, however attentive this
single audience, it was not the same thing as the rousing applause
that made his wits glitter in the midst of the wild good-fellowship. His
adventures, robbed of the drolleries and stripped of the fantastic details
that had made the laughter and the interest, sounded tedious enough.</p>

<p>Ah, Noll, thou numbskull! hath it not dawned upon thee, then, that
thou canst kill this all so precious love for thee by these ignorings of
it&mdash;just as much by neglect of her for the goodwill of thy rollicking
so-called friends as by neglect of her for another woman? Indeed,
the difference is but a toy of hypocrisy. If thou must drift off to
selfish pursuits, what boots it that thy pursuit be this or that or the
other? If thou must needs bawl thy share of the chorus in the night-haunts
of the poetasters, why not have her dear companionship beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thee? Does it fulfil thy manhood the more to frequent the taverns at
night in the boon fellowship of these little spendthrift intelligences?
Hast thou more of magnificence in this killing of time than in the
sweet comradeship of this one whose name is like to ring out over the
four corners of the world wheresoever thy language is spoken? In the
years to come the greatest will seek her companionship, treasure her
smile; yet she will be the same woman then, is therefore the same
now&mdash;if thou hadst but the world&#8217;s acclamation to point thee to it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LVIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Tears of Compassion heal the Bleeding Feet of a
Straying Woman</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> fell feverishly a-drowsing as the chill dawn crept stealthily
into the room. When she awoke, Noll was still sleeping.</p>

<p>As she sat up in bed, heavy with unfinished sleep, she remembered
the letter of the night before. She slipped out of bed and
dressed.</p>

<p>She descended gloomy stairways that were still haunted by the
lingering shadows of the departed night.</p>

<p>She hurried to Moll Davenant&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>The leaves were falling from the trees, and their bitter scent
filled the air with the pungent fragrance of late autumn.</p>

<p>Betty had not seen Moll for some weeks now&mdash;the door had
been sternly closed to her knock. But she decided to haunt the
threshold until she got admittance.</p>

<p>There was little need for setting the will to a stern resolution.
As Betty reached the topmost step of the high climb she paused
to take breath; and from within the door she heard the harsh
cough that told of the girl&#8217;s struggle for life.</p>

<p>She knocked, and, waiting for another fit of coughing to pass,
she knocked again.</p>

<p>A dreary pause, and the door opened.</p>

<p>Babette&#8217;s face peered round it. She put her finger to her lip
and came out on to the landing, kissed Betty, tears in her eyes,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is dying. I got admittance two days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty went in, and as she halted on the threshold, her heart
stood still.</p>

<p>Seated on the side of her bed, in her poor worn night-gown, was
Moll Davenant, struggling for breath.</p>

<p>Betty ran to her, knelt down beside her, and drew a blanket
about the shoulders and limbs; and, as she did so, she saw that
her body was wasted as with old age. She saw also, with the
quick sight that is given to us in emotional moments, that the
place was well kept&mdash;proofs of the care of Babette&#8217;s hands were
everywhere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Moll Davenant stopped coughing, and a smile came into her
eyes. She let Betty put her gently into the warm bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty, dear heart,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;kneel by my bed, that I may
keep my hand on your head a little while.... I am broken&mdash;broken&mdash;wounded&mdash;dying....
But God in His mercy has sent
you&mdash;and my feet have ceased to bleed&mdash;there are no thorns upon
the road now&mdash;no roughnesses. I cease from stumbling. And
there is the light&mdash;flashing up&mdash;from afar. And the song of birds.
The spring must be coming.... I have nearly gone mad for
want of you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-sh! Molly&mdash;I am here,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Eustace Lovegood stepped to Molly&#8217;s bed, the others slipped
quietly from the lamp-lit room....</p>

<p>The big man had been seated on the side of the bed some time,
with Moll&#8217;s slender fingers in his great hand, when she awoke and
found him there.</p>

<p>She leaped up and clasped her arms about him, as a frightened
child runs and hides itself in its mother&#8217;s skirts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Molly,&#8221; said he, taking her terrified face between his hands
and holding her eyes to his until the pallid face of fear became a
flush of shyness: &#8220;Molly, you are not frightened?&#8221;</p>

<p>She buried her face on his neck:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a mistake&mdash;a large mistake, all through,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>The big man put her gently into the bed&mdash;the air was nipping,
spite of the room&#8217;s warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Moll, you always overstate a case.&#8221; He smiled sadly.
&#8220;You even admire my verses.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed in spite of herself&mdash;gladly; but fear lurked in her
eyes. Her mood turned to sudden terror. She leaped up, and
held him with fearful hands&mdash;the sweat stood in cold beads upon
her flesh:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Eustace; don&#8217;t go away again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Moll&mdash;I will never go away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He soothed her, racked with the torture of violent coughing,
her veins standing out like cords upon the torn meagre body;
and as the struggle ran down he set her gently back amongst the
pillows and warm bedclothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Molly, you must be still&mdash;Betty sent me word that you were
ill&mdash;and I have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay, her eyes closed, her hand in the big protecting hand
of the great-hearted man who sat beside her; lay so quietly there
that he thought she slept.</p>

<p>After awhile she turned to him and spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lain here, panic-stricken, doomed, wholly terrified,
alone&mdash;in my ears the sound of the worm&#8217;s nibble eating through
the dull wood of the narrow confining coffin&mdash;I have smelt corruption&mdash;I
have died many times&mdash;discarded&mdash;a rejected thing&mdash;flung
into an unwept grave&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Molly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>She smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it is finished. I do not even fear to recall
it. It&#8217;s but a ghost&#8217;s walk seen by daylight&mdash;a ridicule that in
the night was a tragedy. Now there comes to me the fragrance
of flowers. I am in the arms of the sweet brown earth. I rise
through sap and root and stem and blossom of the dear plants to
become life again, and a part of the sweet exhalation of eternity.
My heart&#8217;s blood leaps within me&mdash;I am glad.... Your voice
fills my ears, dear heart&mdash;if God&#8217;s be only as exquisite!...
Yours and Betty&#8217;s and this tender Babette&#8217;s&mdash;the voices of them
that I love are the refrain of an eternal hymn to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Molly&#8221;&mdash;he knelt beside her&mdash;&#8220;I am glad then that I have
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran her slender fingers over his hands with loving touch:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been polluted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They whispered, with
evil satyr eyes upon me, of what they called Love&mdash;and I had so
little a while to live&mdash;and I went. They stripped me naked, body
and soul, and took me furtively down the mean ways of adultery....
Oh, it was such shabby, shabby sin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Molly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Betty came&mdash;and the sunlight with her&mdash;and sweetness
and delight. And this other wounded woman brought me the
light&mdash;brought her to me&mdash;led me into pleasant ways again....
And thou, dear heart, at the end of the journeying&mdash;that I might
know love before I died.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am wasted, shrivelled, withered like the old,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;look
at me and see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She watched him hungrily, with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>He put his arms about her and held her to him.</p>

<p>She flung her arms about his great head, and held his face close
to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worth dying&mdash;to have loved a <i>man</i>,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She lay back quietly for a long while, gazing at the big fellow,
who put her back so gently amongst the propping pillows, where
he sat beside her. Her eyes were rid of frown and fret, suspicion
and distrust gone wholly from her. She held his hand in pathetic
transparent fingers; and a smile played about the corners of her
mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art wholly mine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They will none know thee
as I know thee, my beloved&mdash;the hearing of none will hang expectant
on thy footfall as my hearing has served thee&mdash;none will
wait upon thy dear whims as my whims have waited&mdash;the notes
and shades of thy dear voice shall arouse in none other the sweet
reverberations that have echoed in the hollows of my quick ears....
Thou wilt bury with me thy largest self.... I die wholly
rich.... The rest may have the unessential husk of thee....
Thou hast given me the Realities.... Thou hast brought me
into Paradise....&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For near upon a month Moll Davenant lay a-dying to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sublime litany of a great passion; and in her dying touched the
hem of the garment that veils the majesty of Life.</p>

<p>She died on the Day of the Dead&mdash;her slender fingers in Betty&#8217;s&mdash;passed,
with a little sigh of glad relief to be asleep, into the
eternal mystery.</p>

<p>Eustace Lovegood, his head buried in his arms, knelt by the
bed. He was roused to consciousness of death by a sob from
Betty as she touched the sightless eyes and drew down the blinds
of the dead woman&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, a great tear trickling slowly down the gentle
fellow&#8217;s pale cheek, &#8220;she was happy, indeed, to go into the dark
holding your dear hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last leaves of the year were falling, a threadbare russet
carpet to their feet, as they bore Moll&#8217;s still white body to her
grave. Babette with Betty added the holiness of her innocent
heart&#8217;s service to the simple dignity of the slow procession.</p>

<p>As they turned out of the street into the Boule Miche, all wayfarers
halting and standing with heads uncovered as the poor
silent body passed to its chill resting-place&mdash;children ceasing
from play, hushedly, to pull off caps of reverence; workmen and
loafers, students and women, merchants and servants, paying
homage to that strange procession of the dead which all must one
day lead&mdash;a workman turned to another:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor soul,&#8221; said he, with a great pity&mdash;&#8220;she will never walk
Paris again.&#8221;</p>

<p>So might that sorrowing angel have spoken as, with irrevocable
clang, he sadly shut on departing Eve the excluding gates of
Paradise.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is suspect that our Betty has the Healing Touch</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> had early perceived, with wise foreseeing eyes, that life&#8217;s
scheme is not work nor leisure nor sleep. The human day is compact
of all that makes for happy sanity&mdash;work and rest and the
decent pleasures that are called recreation&mdash;each as important
as the other, each a part of the triple crown that tops the human
day&#8217;s achievement. Every mortal has the birthright to this
splendid heritage; and where there is lack in the three, there
has been filching. There be foul rogues who ever shirk the toil,
and such must of necessity steal another&#8217;s leisure to overfill his own
measure.</p>

<p>Work Betty never shirked.</p>

<p>The work done, she would go for the bracing walk along the
banks of the Seine before the dusk fell in tender greys upon the
quays of the city. Or the Foolish Virgins, one or several, would
call up into the twilight, whooping her down from her high lodgment,
and take her for a ramble along the quays or into the elaborately
planned wildness of the city&#8217;s woods, or straight across the
river into the boulevards with their glitter and colour and the
shops of fashion; or away up to the heights of Montmartre they
would step it, climbing the steep streets to look down upon the
city, and home again, loitering before print-shops and places where
they sell artistic things. And the &#8220;boys&#8221; would always halt before
the <i>modes</i>, that Betty might have a good hint of the fashion&mdash;they
were proud of her beauty, proud of her comradeship. Babette,
too, would come, and, as they went, talk her genial frank talk,
full of shrewd observation and worldly wisdom. Bartholomew
Doome, too, more than once, had been of the party&mdash;another
Doome, without a hint of sin upon his lips, a strange Doome
who was without pose, devoid of Byronic gloom, lacking as to
insincerities, a Doome who spoke tenderly of children and showed
intimate and wondrous knowledge of their ways&mdash;altogether an
astounding strange Doome.</p>

<p>Noll, only, was now too often absent. He had other things
to do&mdash;had &#8220;something on&#8221;&mdash;urgent nothings amongst the
nobodies.</p>

<p>It is the busy people that find time to do everything&mdash;but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
be wholly idle. The idle it is that have no leisure to be anything
but idle.</p>

<p>Indeed, Betty was busy enough in these days. It came as an
instinct that she should be the healer. As a wounded child, with
confident appeal, looks to the grown-up to banish pain, so such
as were in distress plucked at Betty&#8217;s sleeve asking comfort.
When a student lay dying, he would always send for Betty&mdash;when
one raved in restless delirium of fever it was Betty that sat
writing by the bed and brought gentleness into the harsh atmosphere&mdash;it
was to Betty&#8217;s discreet ears that was unfolded the
long-hidden tangle of the secret man, the struggle of the troubled
soul flinching from the cowardice of its own shabby reservations&mdash;Betty&#8217;s
hands that quieted the restless brain, and her calm
command that brought back honour. Her dear ears were shut
to all strange peevishness or conceit that the unmasked egoist
unconsciously uttered. Her presence cleansed the talk, her sweet
humour raised the clean laugh, her intelligence roused the sense
of dignity, and the gaiety of her fresh young vigorous womanhood
made of the sickroom a pleasaunce, and of the world outside a
garden of fragrant blossom.</p>

<p>And Babette, who was fellow conspirator in her offices, and
hung upon her ordering, though she had a gossip tongue, knew
no English.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Betty feels the Keen Breath of Winter</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll</span> took it all very much for granted, this large-hearted service
of Betty to her fellows. He felt that it reflected the very greatest
credit on her womanhood. It added stature to her natural
dignity.</p>

<p>When Betty had been away, watching over the last flickering
days of Moll Davenant, it seemed natural enough&mdash;it was perhaps
a little lonely at moments&mdash;but he arranged to pass the days
pleasantly in closer good-fellowship with rollicking companions.
When Molly was gone, put away in the obliterating earth; whilst
the mystery of the corruption of the white body (that had lived
so strenuously and laughed and wept and loved so fiercely itself
and others only to end in the grave), whilst the why and the
whence and the whither of it all roused the most profound emotions
in the vibrant imagination of Betty, Noll had settled into
a very merry and slovenly way of life; and he kept up the untidy
habit.</p>

<p>For Betty&#8217;s entertainment he would occasionally forego some
meeting of his boon companions, and show a boisterous rally of
the old comradeship, as on Christmas Day, which was kept by
them all in right jovial English fashion.</p>

<p>The whole crew of them dined at a students&#8217; restaurant, and
everything was <i>√† l&#8217;anglais</i>, a fact not in the least discounted by
the strangeness of each dish to English eyes and palate. Indeed,
the plum-pudding alone awakened the familiar recognition, for it
had a piece of holly a-top, and Gaston Latour got enough delight
out of setting on fire the encircling brandy in the dish to comfort
him for the suppression of the hunting-horn by the police.</p>

<p>The generous humours of the occasion were only marred by a
slightly too generous flow of wine; the which had been of small
moment in itself, had it not chanced that it loosed Noll&#8217;s tongue,
and he, growing somewhat garrulous under the ruddy excitement,
and feeling compelled to shine, did not hesitate to give more than
a sly cut at Betty in the midst of the railleries, crying out in mock
defence of her that when she <i>did</i> finish her masterpiece it might
make a noise in the world, <i>though it certainly took a long time in
the making</i>! Betty became aware at a stroke that for months he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
had been criticizing her, silently fretting at her industry. It were
as if he had lashed at her with a whip. He could not leave it
alone. He had another cut, a cheerfully ironic reference to
Casauban&#8217;s unfruitful pedantry in his <i>Key to All the Mythologies</i>
that never came to anything but the threat of its promise, the
work that the prig is always <i>going to do</i>&mdash;the jibe was intended as
a veiled reference to Betty&#8217;s careful workmanship, and to enhance
the fact that he himself &#8220;knocked off&#8221; his successes with something
of the facility of a great gift.</p>

<p>Betty&#8217;s sensitive ear lost no slightest shade of the sneer amidst
all the jovial manner; it was not wasted upon her. It stung her
to the quick. From any other mouth it would have passed her
by, a dog&#8217;s snap. It revealed to her in one ugly moment that all
the work she had done to increase his ease for work, all her forbearing
patience to his encroachment upon her own working hours,
all her care to free his hands from drudgeries and release his wits
to the full concentration on his career, all was already largely
forgotten&mdash;worse, had been scarcely appreciated. And, somehow,
the wild spirits of the evening failed to reach her; she was
in a daze, she had received a buffet full in the face from the hand
from which she had least feared it. And it was the sign of her
splendid selflessness that she was sickeningly struck with pity
that he could be guilty of this meanness&mdash;she was filled with
a strange bewildering shame, not because the blow had been
delivered, not because it had struck her, but that it had come
from the one in all the world who, more than any, fouled his
hand in the act. She flinched from that punishment as from
an abyss that yawned.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Landlord of</i> The Scarlet Jackass <i>is unable to sing
his Song</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the tavern of <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i> the hero of the evening was
a young poet who had that day found a publisher. The wines
and ale went round. Amidst uproar they were crowning the old
mad poet Gattepo√©sie with a wreath of pure white roses, where he
sat blinking and smiling in a chair upon a table, that he, having
uttered a panegyric upon the new immortal, after the manner of
the Academy, might conduct him to the chair and crown him;
and it was in the midst of the resulting fooleries that Noll, nudging
Horace Malahide, noticed the absence of Andr√© Joyeux&mdash;missing
the flow of his rollicking wit and the effect of his commanding
personality.</p>

<p>He signed to one of the waiters, an enormous stout man, chosen
by Andr√© because he resembled Renan in his Academic uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar√ßon,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;where is the master?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was resting&mdash;upstairs&mdash;in the room just over the tavern.
He was only allowed to drink milk&mdash;he was in need of rest.</p>

<p>The young Englishmen said they would go up and see him, and
the waiter leading the way, the two young fellows followed him
up the private stair. At the door the waiter knocked, and left
them. They entered.</p>

<p>On his bed lay Andr√© Joyeux, his face deathly pale, and a
drawn look about the eyes.</p>

<p>He received the two young fellows affectionately, held Noll&#8217;s
hand, embraced Horace.</p>

<p>Noll found himself mute. But the sick man saw that he was
affected, and patted him on the shoulder&mdash;it was only nerves, he
said&mdash;it would pass&mdash;he would soon be giving them</p>

<p>&mdash;they should have the rousing chorus&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The distant sound of laughter below checked him, and brought
a frown to his knit brows.</p>

<p>He sank back on his pillows, shutting his eyes, wearily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>But the noise below fretted his ears, and the baffling bursts of
laughter and applause kept his mind going, seeking the cause,
restless, inquisitive.</p>

<p>Noll drew a chair beside his bed, he offered to come and look
after him; but Andr√© patted his hand, put his offer aside,
laughed pathetically, said he would soon be all right&mdash;they should
see&mdash;they would very soon again have</p>

<div class="verse">Proud as kings and loud as carters,</div>

<p>The sound of a song being sung below brought a questioning
frown to the sick man&#8217;s eyes again. Who was it playing? What
was the song? He did not recognise it!</p>

<p>Noll asked if he might not send them all away&mdash;he would stop
the noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Andr√©. &#8220;Let them sing their songs&mdash;it was
Guitreau who had found a publisher&mdash;he had himself discovered
Guitreau&mdash;it would be boorish to spoil his evening&mdash;no, no&mdash;let
them sing their songs. We have only once to live&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was loud laughter....</p>

<p>They had sat awhile in silence, when Noll asked if they could
do nothing.</p>

<p>No; he wanted for nothing. The waiters were good souls.
Everyone had been kind. No.... He thought he would now
sleep.</p>

<p>He embraced them, and they left the room&mdash;crept from it
silently, some strange instinct and dread dictating their going
a-tiptoe.</p>

<p>And as Noll turned to close the door, the wan-faced man in the
gloom of the ill-lit room ran his hand wearily over his brow and
flung his arm restlessly upon the coverlet.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center"><i>Wherein a Comely Young Woman waits at a Window all Night,
watching for Sir Tom Fool&mdash;listening for his Step</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bleak night without was cold as God&#8217;s contempt. The
March wind shrieked shrilly about the court, swung up out of
the resounding blackness, tugged at the shutters of windows,
rattled at all loose things ill-naturedly, smote the walls in a huff,
and tossed insolently out of the court again, shrilly screaming&mdash;leaving
a gloomy sullen lull, full of dry-throated questionings.</p>

<p>A bride of a year&mdash;and anxious self-questionings!</p>

<p>Betty sat at the window, uneasy, watchful, ashamed. All
evening had she come and gone, pacing out disturbing thoughts.
Many nights had she thus watched, humiliated, alone&mdash;watching
for Noll, listening for his footfall. Once the city clocks had
struck midnight, the passing of each wheeled conveyance became
a goad to her anxious hearing&mdash;a stab to her anxiety&mdash;an added
sneer at the loss of her hold upon her lover&#8217;s affections&mdash;a muffled
insult to her attractiveness.</p>

<p>A year ago had been a wedding-day&mdash;this morning the youth
had whistled out of the house wholly forgetful of it. A year ago
this room had been a garden of flowers scattered from a wedding-bouquet&mdash;this
night the room was wholly bare of flowers. A
year ago had been wondrous tendernesses, and watchful care
over her that had been a very burden of sweet attentions&mdash;eyes
that hungered, ears that listened to her every whisper, hands
that burnt into her white flesh, caresses that shamed her with
delight&mdash;to-day was criticism, excusings of neglect, carelessnesses.</p>

<p>To-morrow, perchance, Youth would cease even to excuse
itself.</p>

<p>A year ago had seen youth and maid climb lightheartedly to
the harsh garret of the world&#8217;s toil, full of high hopes and noble
purpose, stepping it gleefully, clear-eyed, will and heart inflamed
with the Certainties. To-day the very Certainties of yesterday
were crumbling into ashen doubts.</p>

<p>She ate her heart out, silently, with womanhood&#8217;s uncomplaining
dignity; yet was her soul riven by this fool&#8217;s folly&mdash;his
littlest harshnesses turning to bitterness in these long night-watches.
His forgetfulnesses, his ignorings, his egotisms, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
irresolutions&mdash;how they all took shape and grew in bogey ugliness,
indeed to something of their true scarecrow ugliness, as she
brooded upon them, raising the nauseating dead out of the ashes
of her experience!</p>

<p>Nay, so fatuous his conceit, he must needs even rob her of the
dignity of her work, sneer at the child of her imagination, leave
her nothing. But he had wasted bad manners. Genius is serene
in the confidence of its mighty Patiences. Time waits upon the
great Wills.</p>

<p>Then she would make excuses for him. Of a truth, he had had
a little vogue&mdash;stood well with his fellows&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he wrecked his own cause.</p>

<p>In a passing mood of conceit he had strutted it in the mock-modest
manner, tapping his own chest, half ashamed to drag in
so modest a fellow. But look at him&mdash;even him! and the like;
and forthwith averred that he &#8220;knocked off&#8221; more in an hour
sometimes than she in a month&mdash;the &#8220;knocking off&#8221; inferring
fertility and facility of genius. The which, whatever it lacked
in the courtesies, held at least some virtue of truth.</p>

<p>But Truth may walk abroad too naked.</p>

<p>Ah, Betty&mdash;and if thou, looking out of thy window, couldst
but see with thy clear eyes across the lamp-lit city this Noll of
thine!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Ceiling of the Tavern that is called</i> The Scarlet
Jackass <i>is stained with Blood</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll</span> was at a gathering of little men&mdash;at a students&#8217; tavern on
the heights of Montmartre. The praises of the mediocrities
flushed him. His eyes were bright; he had glittered.</p>

<p>Ah, Noll; and there is one who watches for thee, sitting alone,
her handsome head bowed by the midnight lamp to give thee
welcome. She is thy one selfless friend&mdash;with brain whose verdict
is worth all the splutterings of these bedraggled talents that sit
about thy self-sufficient elbows!...</p>

<p>That was a rousing night at the tavern of <i>The Scarlet Jackass</i>.</p>

<p>The room was choked with the wild rioting bohemians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;mon Dieu!&mdash;one minute&mdash;one minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiters rushed to and fro, perspiring, white aprons flying.</p>

<p>The glass went round.</p>

<p>So the place roared with laughter and riot and noisy good-fellowship
and song.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the crowd began to thin out, and the place emptied of all
but the regular frequenters, the old mad poet, his chin sunk on
his chest where he snored in a chair, his wreath of roses askew
over his ear, roused and asked for Andr√© Joyeux&mdash;he regretted
that he had not been there&mdash;he missed his waggeries.</p>

<p>At the mention of his name they called the head-waiter, who
lay a-drouse in a corner. No, he had not seen the master since
sundown. There had been no time to go and see him&mdash;but he
had only to ring his bell should he have need of anything. He
was sleeping, they trusted, content that his tavern was filled to
overflowing&mdash;he had need of sleep&mdash;much sleep. Yes, yes; it
had been a mad night indeed&mdash;a great night. Yes; the English
gentlemen might go up and see the master if they would but go
very quietly&mdash;yes, they might all go, if they would but go very
quietly, in case he slept&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Noll and Horace stumbled up the dark stair that was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
half revealed in the smoky haze of the dusk that goes before the
dawn. Opening the door stealthily, they looked in, and saw that
amongst the other departing shadows that lingered there, a dead
man lay stretched upon the floor, the scarlet brand of a bullet-wound
on his pale brow. The red blood showed on the white skin,
a waxen seal upon his last mysterious testament.</p>

<p>And as the others, befogged with the potations of their riot,
entered the room, close-following at their heels, they solemnly
took off their hats&mdash;the old mad poet last of all and with a mighty
hiccup.</p>

<p>Yes, Andr√© Joyeux slept at last&mdash;and slept well. He would
ring no more for sleeping-draughts. He had no more needs.
His philosophies were at an end. In a loud burst of merriment
that had echoed from below, he had taken his life, the pistol
unheard in the frantic applause.</p>

<p>They lifted up the poor lifeless body and placed it upon the bed&mdash;the
arms restless no longer now&mdash;the body still, in the strange
silence of death.</p>

<p>An old bohemian stepped forward and looked down on the
pallid peaceful face; stooped and kissed the dead man upon the
cheek. He stood and looked down upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He took me from beggary and starvation in a garret,&#8221; said
he.... &#8220;Ah, that was an artist! And&mdash;he knew how to live.
He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Angel of the Annunciation enters into a Garret</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the chill grey of an April dawn crept across her silent garret,
sweeping the frayed shadow of the night aside to join other lurking
shadows in gloomy corners, Betty, in white night-robe, was
awakened and sat up in bed, all in a strange wonder and alarm.</p>

<p>With unuttered timorous questionings, with delicious fears, out
of the void she heard the first whisper of the annunciation of her
motherhood. As the sea-voice carols ghostly refrains of mystic
adventures within the music-haunted chambers of a sea-shell, so,
to the hollows of her subtle ears, came exquisite murmurings that
to her ecstatic fancy held the quick rhythmic breathings that are
the sleep of a little child; and, of a sudden, her white body glowed
and her dear breasts swelled at the dream-touch of infant-fingers&mdash;leaped
to the greedy caress of infant lips. Her comely limbs
shivered, fearful with a thousand fears; her whole being flushed
hot&mdash;she was dumb with bewildering muteness before the majesty
of the mystery of a new life.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Across the murk of the stress of life that is the dust-storm up-blown
from the sordid details of living&mdash;across the dreary fog that
is compact of the accumulations of vain strivings and failings and
galling insolences&mdash;across the black clouds of the humiliations
and the indignities that are flung along the path of womanhood
under cover of the fulsome hypocrisies, there leaped, with rainbow
brilliancy, the bright sign that gladness is the law, the night
but the shadow of the light, that there is laughter in the firmament
and gaiety and delight, and on the earth a splendid wayfaring.</p>

<p>She smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>She arose from her bed, and stood amazed. She saw visions.</p>

<p>The bare garret of her motherlessness swung away from beneath
her exquisite feet, vanished in frantic vertigo from her ken. She put
out dazed hands. And lo! as her wounded feet, climbing upwards
always, topped the hill of her pilgrimage&mdash;the clouds lifted&mdash;she
stepped into the garden of her kingdom. She heard a call, and
she answered the call&mdash;stood at last at the threshold of the innermost
sanctuary of the most holy place in the magnificent palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
along life&#8217;s journey&mdash;the room where the children play. There,
where were little arms held out to her, little hands that clung to her
skirts, she sank to her knees&mdash;her ears deliriously a-riot with
the patter of small feet, the prattle of child&#8217;s gossip, the laughter
of the little gladsome ones. Her eyes were large with the vision of
the coming years&mdash;bruises and small troubles and still smaller
wounds she saw brought to her knees with childlike confidence
in the certainty of balm.</p>

<p>She sobbed, and sank upon the bed.</p>

<p>Ay, thou winsome one; yet even here may be wrought scars
also in thy heart. Ah, thou most happy thou, to have a heart
that may be thus scarred!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When womanhood, idled with such fearful ecstasies, quickened
with the mystery of a new life, alarmed with chill dreads, yet
pulsing to the rhythm of an added glory, realizes her lover as
greater than lover&mdash;it is at this time of all times that he should
be at her side. But Noll was taken up with trivial things; so
trivial that he thought them serious&mdash;so far had he lost the focus
of noble vision.</p>

<p>The garret was possessed with the gloomy announcement of a
drizzling new day when Noll opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>Betty, crouching on her bed, held out her arms to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; she began, tears in her eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Noll went to her, caressed her, and sat himself down on the side
of the bed.</p>

<p>He yawned.</p>

<p>He was very tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; said he, heedless of the eagerness in her voice, deaf
to the strange thrill in her being, his eyes on his own amusements,
his thoughts on his own fatigue; &#8220;Betty, I am dog-weary&mdash;I
have to be off again at six&mdash;I must snatch a couple of hours sleep.&#8221;
He flung into an armchair, dressed as he was. &#8220;You might give
me a rouse at six&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He yawned again and was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; she said shyly&mdash;&#8220;I have felt so strange&mdash;whilst&mdash;whilst
you were away&mdash;during the night. And just as the dawn
was breaking I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll moved uneasily in his chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Betty, dear heart,&#8221; said he drowsily, a suspicion of
compunction stirring within his gadding conscience that this girl
had been too much alone of late. He misunderstood her delicacy.
His conceit jumped to the uneasy conclusion that she was blaming
him. &#8220;You see, the whole of the last few days our fellows
have been toiling day and night at our car for the procession at
the Bal des Quatz Arts; but it&mdash;is&mdash;finished. To-day has come
at last&mdash;to-day we hold&mdash;the&mdash;orgy&mdash;of youth&mdash;to-night is the
Bal des Quatz Arts.... After to-night, sweetheart, I shall be
able to get home earlier.... I am afraid&mdash;I haven&#8217;t&mdash;done&mdash;my
duty by you&mdash;of late....&#8221; He roused for a moment. &#8220;By
George, our studio is going to win the laurels at the students&#8217; ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
this evening&mdash;we have been at it all night, putting the last touches
to our great plaster statue of the Goddess of War&mdash;a huge copy of
G√©r√¥me&#8217;s Bellona&mdash;looks terrific&mdash;one of our fellows has done a
splendid frieze for the gilt chariot that is to bear her majesty&mdash;we
finished her toilette&mdash;at daybreak. And now I feel like a lady&#8217;s-maid
to a woman of fashion, waiting up all night to&mdash;take off the
garments&mdash;of&mdash;victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>He yawned. His eyes closed:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;oh&mdash;ah&mdash;I must stop cackling indifferent prose....
The massier of our studio wants us all back at six.... We have
to get Bellona to the Moulin Rouge for this evening&#8217;s show, and
she has a heavy tread&mdash;as becomes the goddess of War. We are
going to&mdash;drag her&mdash;across Paris with&mdash;ropes&mdash;up to Montmartre....
It will be&mdash;a rollicking&mdash;march.... Our lot at
G√©r√¥me&#8217;s studio&mdash;always begin early&mdash;and&mdash;stay&mdash;late.&#8221; He
yawned heavily &#8220;Hi-yo-ho!... Yes&mdash;it will be a&mdash;rollicking&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He relapsed into a drowse.</p>

<p>He started up for a moment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Half a hundred French students make&mdash;an&mdash;ex&#8217;lent&mdash;flea&mdash;in
th&#8217; ear&mdash;of&mdash;Paris.... An&mdash;ex&#8217;lent&mdash;flea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence took possession of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll roused:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;let me see&mdash;where were we?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed embarrassedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;we&#8217;re to march her across Paris to the tune of the
Marseillaise.... We&#8217;ve been practising the Marseillaise all
night, Gaston Latour&#8217;s hunting-horn going full blare. We&#8217;ve
been raising the ghosts&mdash;I can&mdash;promise you.... It&#8217;s a strange&mdash;thing&mdash;how
few patriots know the words of&mdash;their own&mdash;national
anthem! However&mdash;tra-la-la, sung loud enough&mdash;goes
a long way&mdash;to&mdash;express a patriot&#8217;s parochial emotion. An-extra&mdash;ordinary&mdash;long&mdash;way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He mumbled into a drowse.</p>

<p>Betty made a last effort to tell him, before he should relapse
into sleep:</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a strange thing has happened&mdash;to me&mdash;Noll,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-s?&#8221; drawled he, missing the shy hint.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>His heavy breathing told that he slept.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For two weary hours, Betty sat up in bed lest sleep should overcome
her, and Noll miss his rouse. And brooding there, her chin
on her knees, her sorry vigil dragged through the laggard minutes.</p>

<p>As the clocks struck six across the city&#8217;s roofs, she crept out of
bed and roused Noll; and he, after much rousing, got up, vague-eyed
and wit-wandering, embraced her, and, searching for his hat,
put it on and lurched out of the room in a drowsy daze.</p>

<p>Betty reeled from the cruelty&mdash;stumbled&mdash;and was overwhelmed
with sickness.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Betty walks into the Desert</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> was dressed for a journey.</p>

<p>On the floor, near the table whereat she sat writing a letter, lay
a battered old black trunk, strapped and labelled.</p>

<p>The day was chilly grey without.</p>

<p>As she blotted the last lines, there came to her hearing, from
the thoroughfares of the Latin Quarter below, rollicking snatches
of song, and the stir of students in noisy holiday mood.</p>

<p>Betty brushed aside her tears, and read carefully the letter she
had just signed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Noll</span>,</p>

<p>A year ago I was writing you love-letters&mdash;delightful
deliriousness more full of meaning than of sense. To-day I am
writing farewell.</p>

<p>It is the most eager desire of my life, of my whole being, that
you should be free&mdash;to be a man. I came to you, joined my life
to yours, that you should be free to realize yourself, most wholly
free&mdash;in body, in intellect, and in conscience. I now take back
my life from yours, that, having failed with me to achieve freedom
for yourself or for me, you shall be free to become free&mdash;or as near
free as you may be.</p>

<p>Your life is become full of little secrecies&mdash;of half-told tales&mdash;of
timid reservations&mdash;of pompously withheld mysteries&mdash;of
little excuses. I can only live, for close companionship, with a
man; and a man shall not fear himself&mdash;nor another.</p>

<p>You must live free from the need to hide yourself from me.
Therefore, to give you back to yourself I withdraw myself.</p>

<p>No man that is master of himself would live with a woman
who is not also free&mdash;the free associate only with the free&mdash;they
do not consort with curs, whether men or women. It is fools&#8217; cant
that speaks of the woman <i>obeying</i> the man&mdash;such a man were only
fit to be the father of a slave people.</p>

<p>And more&mdash;the woman in marriage must be free to live her
nobility.</p>

<p>I am not of those puling women who, when they are flung
aside or suffer rebuff, cling to the arm of him who strikes the blow&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
whimper and cringe and are content to be content if they
but have occasional consideration. Least of all am I of those
women who, being stung with a man&#8217;s neglect and jibe and injustice,
walk through a haggard existence by the man&#8217;s shrinking
side, keeping his allegiance by the dread of her crying out upon
him to the neighbours, driving him with scowl or invective along
a narrow path where his unwilling feet are kept from straying
only through fear for his petty dignities&mdash;making him a slave to
his weaknesses and hers, and herself a hissing whip and a shame.
Such women are of the slave-peoples&mdash;they mother a race of
weaklings. For fear is as much through the mother as the father.</p>

<p>But, you will say, &#8216;Let us explain, let us make it up and kiss
and be friends, let us bury the past.&#8217; So indeed we might sit by
the wayside of life and babble threadbare platitudes to hide our
losses. Would that be music in our ears? Would it be gain?
Even if you hoodwinked me with pathetic promises of duty and
the like, is our strength increased?</p>

<p>The conventions of the world might be satisfied by my meekly
bowing my head and walking primly by your side. But the past
is immortal, and rises again from the dead. We might take our
walks abroad together, but we should no longer go hand in hand&mdash;a
ghost strides between. He smells of the dead most unconscionably,
this fawning spectre of little diplomacies. Pah! how
I detest the cringing flunkey that speaks in apologies!</p>

<p>You would not have me walk along a way of frequent reconciliations&mdash;each
reconciliation a humiliation&mdash;each humiliation
making that uneasy ghost that stalks between us into a more
tangible figure of Hate. Reconciliations! of what? for what?
You do not think me so little free that I would stoop to call for
explanations&mdash;explanations that but explain why explanations
should not be.</p>

<p>What have you or I to do with the conventions of the world,
when all&#8217;s said? We are not the hirelings of the world. Are you
and I the timid servants of the gossips?</p>

<p>Life is an affirmation&mdash;a great Thou Shalt&mdash;not an enfeebling
incubus of belittling Thou Shalt Nots.</p>

<p>Love, like friendship, will not suffer catechism&mdash;does not rest
on commandments&mdash;does not increase through rebuff.</p>

<p>Life is not a bundle of apologies&mdash;how much less then is Love,
which is of the essence of Life! Love is a splendid comrade&mdash;not
an excuse for small disdains.</p>

<p>I have given you all my love. I have not bartered it. I do
not haggle over its value. Nor for my part would I hedge you
about with restrictions, nor win your smiles on conditions&mdash;for
willing comradeship sunk to dutiful loyalty is become a restriction.
I ask for no paper treaties. I will fling you no Thou Shalt Nots.
The written promise is the least part of a strong man&#8217;s honour.</p>

<p>If a man or woman, or the shabby travesties of these, would
find delight in adulteries, will the written bond or public proclamation
of fidelity prevent their secret treacheries?</p>

<p>I can no more stoop to jealousy of the world than of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
woman, even if I were possessed of the mean insanity of jealousy,
which is but a part of the village-idiot&#8217;s wits who sits in the winter
and thinks to blow dead ashes into living fire if his rude breath be
but harsh enough.</p>

<p>Nor can I, on the other hand, live in your house as &#8216;one of
three.&#8217; If you and I and Apology essayed to live together, it
could not last. I cannot embrace Apology with effusion; and I
cannot brook to see you yield yourself to shabby excuses. I am
not sure that I would not rather have you committing mean sins
with a dairymaid.</p>

<p>The pain with which my hand writes these lines it would be
wanton cruelty to inflict upon you, Noll; yet I will tell you that
since I collected a few belongings together into my poor weather-beaten
trunk&mdash;indeed, I have never before realized how shabby a
dowry I brought to you, dear heart (I have scarred the dear walls
with as little brigandage as I might, so that they shall stare upon
you with no eyeless sockets and be the less lonely home for you
when I am gone)&mdash;since I have taken a last look round the rooms
where I have known the best days of my life, as I sit waiting for
the vehicle which is to take me out into the desert again, I find it
hard to keep back the tears from blotting out my handwriting.
Scalding tears, Noll; yet I have wept tears also that did not
scald, happy tears&mdash;indeed, I have but this moment kissed the
pillows of our marriage-bed....</p>

<p>But there are wheels that stop outside the courtyard gate.
Just one more round of our old home amidst the stars, to touch
the dear surrounding things I have loved so well&mdash;<i>we</i> have loved
so well&mdash;and I am gone.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Betty.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Ah, Noll; there are no flowers upon the balcony now!
Not even a little one to take in remembrance that the balcony
was once a garden.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a rustle of skirts on the landing without&mdash;a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>Betty uttered no sound. She thrust the letter into an envelope
and sealed it.</p>

<p>There was another knock, and a panting voice cried from without:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, madame&mdash;Madelaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty went to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Madelaine&mdash;you are back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madelaine, daintily dressed, and her slim being looking charming
and refined, entered the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine!&#8221; exclaimed Betty, &#8220;what a pretty frock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame&mdash;I go to a dressmaker&#8217;s by day now&mdash;the old
miser is content to have me work for her at night.&#8221; She shrugged
her slender shoulders. &#8220;It saves her my meals.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had not become a dressmaker for nothing. Every stitch and
flounce told, bringing out the beauty and lithe grace of the girl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>She was panting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame. But&mdash;mon Dieu, you are of a surety amongst
the stars here!&#8221; Her pretty scarlet lips smiled. &#8220;Amongst the
stars&mdash;as the angels always are. But&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;I went and put
on decent clothes and took your letter to Mademoiselle Babette,
madame; but she was out&mdash;she is preparing for the Bal des Quatz
Arts to-night&mdash;has gone out with Monsieur Horace and the others....
Mon Dieu, yes; you live amongst the stars, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine, have you kept the carriage waiting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame&mdash;it is below.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty arose wearily from her seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you help me to carry down my trunk?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madelaine looked at her sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu, no, madame,&#8221; said she. &#8220;<i>I</i> will carry it. No&mdash;Hodendouche
shall carry it&mdash;he grows fat. Yes, madame; do
not interfere with me&mdash;I will call him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She skipped out on to the landing with swift light step, and
hailed Hodendouche from below.</p>

<p>She came back, her lips parted with the exertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine,&#8221; said Betty&mdash;&#8220;will you come to the station and
see me off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu, yes, madame. I would have gone if I had walked&mdash;in
tight new shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty laughed sadly. She went to her and put her hands on
the girl&#8217;s shoulders. She held her off at arm&#8217;s length. There was
a lovely glow on the girl&#8217;s beautiful dark Southern face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine, you are all a-tremor! What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madelaine laughed gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame; it was intoxicating,&#8221; she said. She hesitated&mdash;almost
shyly for Madelaine. &#8220;When I drove through the
streets&mdash;in the carriage&mdash;it was splendid.... All the world
thought I was some man&#8217;s mistress&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Madelaine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, madame,&#8221; said Madelaine&mdash;&#8220;here&#8217;s Hodendouche.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hodendouche entered the room with a set smile, and took off
his cap.</p>

<p>Madelaine turned to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Hodendouche,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;what a climb to reach the
stars!... But now you are here, pick up that box and take it
downstairs; Madame will follow us in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the grunting Hodendouche shouldered the trunk, and, followed
by Madelaine, left the room, Betty went to the bed and
put the letter upon the white coverlet; and for awhile she lingered
there.</p>

<p>She sat down on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>Ah, youth&#8217;s couch! what limitless imaginings hath thy pillow
known! what vasty ambitions have burnt out upon thee! what
schemings and plannings for the payments of the bare needs of
life! Tears thou hast known, and sighs&mdash;but the stars glittered
ever in the firmament even when it was darkest; and at every
rebuff Resolution reborn put out wounded hands to the heights.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>What hath he known of youth who peered through eyes so
dullard that they saw but the dingy finger-marks upon the stairways
to the attics of the palaces in the bohemia of his teens?</p>

<p>Who so weak of spirit that disdained to climb the stairs to the
topmost garrets when the need was! For did we not sit there
under the roof, expectant amidst the splendid galaxies whilst the
workaday world did blink its myriad utilitarian street-lamps at
our feet!</p>

<p>Ah, those gipsy days of our wander-years, when we strolled,
careless of the infinities, along the blithe alleys of our youthful
wayfarings, and every garret was the topmost chamber of a palace,
and the rough bed but an excuse for splendid dreams!</p>

<p>Betty stooped and kissed the pillow where Noll would sleep.</p>

<p>She let herself out of the room, shut the door softly, and hurriedly
followed the others down the stairs....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fat little concierge, as she bent over her morning coffee-making
in her dark little den by the gateway, was startled by a
vision which appeared to her, kissed her rough old cheek, slipped
a gold piece into her hand, ran out to a carriage, and was gone.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXVI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with the Great Orgy of Youth</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Suzanne!&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The shout rang through the great hall of the Moulin Rouge;
and the vast crowd of dancing revellers, dressed in fancy dress,
stopped their dancing and crowded towards the wide-flung doors
that gave entrance from the gardens.</p>

<p>The leader of the orchestra hurried the jigging mazurka to an
end, and, with blare of the crashing chords that in music stand for
finality, ceased playing the dance-music. He tapped for silence
amongst the ranks of the musicians and held out hushing hands.
He stood up, turned and glanced at the great tribune of the twelve
judges, saw that, arrayed in their splendid robes, they had taken
their seats; saw, too, that the gorgeous stream of colour and
glittering armour was moving in mass of revellers towards the
great doors of the garden entrance:</p>

<p>&#8220;The cavalcade!&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<p>There was a fluttering of white sheets of paper. Settling himself
in his seat, he tapped for attention, swung his baton, and with
resulting crash the orchestra burst into the thundering music of
a triumphal march.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suzanne!&#8221;</p>

<p>The shout went up from the hoarse throats of a thousand fantastically-robed
students, sounding vibrant in the golden haze and
echoing in the blaze of light to the resounding rafters. They drew
their swords, Greek and Roman, and they of the courts of the
Louis, Crusader and Saracen, and Goth and barbarian; the
flashing steel greeted her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suzanne!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon a golden shield, supported high above all heads by four
of the most famous models of Paris, she came, her white body
statuesque and calm; gleaming rosy-tinted, she stood poised in
all her slender beauty&mdash;and as the shout went up she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suzanne!&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew it well. She was in all the beauty of youth&mdash;and her
perfect body not only held the glory of the ancient art of the
sculpture of Greece, but it had the exquisite mystery of life in its
pleasant surface which the art of man cannot utter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>So Suzanne led the procession round the huge hall and was
borne towards the tribune where the judges sat.</p>

<p>After the queen of the models came the procession of the
rival studios. From amidst the crested helms and glittering steel
of Greek and Roman soldiery arose the great figure of the war-goddess
Bellona, the fury standing a-tiptoe, sword and shield
upraised, head thrust forward snake-like, her scarlet mouth
shrieking at topmost pitch the fierce yell to war, her black brows
gathered in black hate; before her feet an angry snake, with head
upraised, darted a black sullen tongue. As the great travesty of
G√©r√¥me&#8217;s awful figure of the lust of blood moved along, there
shone from out the hollows of her staring eyes a pale green light,
cruel and livid. On her gilt chariot she passed, escorted by her
bodyguard of Greek and Roman soldiery, and gave place to the
classic float on which sat the nude young model, Marcelle, posed
as G√©r√¥me&#8217;s exquisite statue of Tanagra. Marcelle&#8217;s slight and
slender girlish figure at this time made her a serious rival to
Suzanne, and was markedly affecting the whole ideal of womanly
beauty and proportion throughout the studios of France. As she
sat, in all the simplicity of pose of a Tanagra figure, the light
making her delicate colour glow, the cry of hoarse admiration for
Bellona changed to a shout for</p>

<p>&#8220;Tanagra!&#8221;</p>

<p>And shout of Tanagra gave way to</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcelle!&#8221;</p>

<p>The swords flashed.</p>

<p>G√©r√¥me&#8217;s students passed, giving place to other schools, each
in its pageant striving to express the ideals of the art which inspired
its chosen master. The rude groups of the barbaric men
who wore but the shaggy skins of animals; the wild groups of
Merovingian and Carlovingian Franks; the dandified figures of
the bewigged and heavy-booted court of the great Louis; the
powdered and patched and silken-habited gentlemen of the last
Louis; the large-lapelled, long-tail-coated and high-stocked
dandies of the Revolution: they all passed with their triumphal
cars, and drew the loud acclamations of the boisterous revellers.</p>

<p>The splendid procession circled round the great hall, passed the
tribune of the judges to the thrash of the martial music; round and
round again. But amidst the frantic din it was soon known that
G√©r√¥me&#8217;s students had won the honours of the night.</p>

<p>As the gladiators and warriors passed the judges&#8217; tribune the
last time before the procession broke up to join the revellers, the
twelve judges stood up in solemn silence, and saluted the goddess
of war and the exquisite figure of the young woman who sat in all
the triumph of her beauty.</p>

<p>They stood whilst G√©r√¥me&#8217;s students passed. And as they so
stood in strange dignity, the emblems of imperial Rome above
them, the battle-axes bound in faggots, and the motto <i>Death to
Tyrants</i> emblazoned between, as they so stood beneath the row
of heads that dripped the blood of the dead tyrants, there floated
across the ages some whisper of the eternal struggle of life, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
survival of the fittest, and of the crowning mystery of the incarnation
of man through the beauty of woman....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the clocks struck three, there was a rush of revellers towards
the procession of waiters who appeared in white aprons carrying
chairs and tables and plates and glasses.</p>

<p>In a trice the place was a great banqueting-hall, white with the
napery of a hundred tables.</p>

<p>The students collected about the boards of their different
studios, thundering for supper with fist-banged poundings upon
the tables, and the singing of songs; which gave way to a roar of
applause when the army of waiters reappeared laden with wine
and the dishes of the feast. And as they ran backwards and
forwards, their white aprons flying, there was the clink of glass
amid the babel of a thousand tongues, and the clatter and roar of
merry-making.</p>

<p>When G√©r√¥me&#8217;s students arose from their table in a body, and
the company of gladiators and Greek and Roman soldiery moved
in an orderly array towards the judges&#8217; tribune, they were greeted
with thunders of applause, which burst out again on their return,
laden with the prize of victory, bottles of wine.</p>

<p>They swept round to their tables; and, opening their ranks,
took possession of their seats. The massier rapped upon the
table, and called for silence.</p>

<p>Standing before them, statuesque in a splendid girdle with the
embroidered cloth hanging therefrom before and behind, stood
Suzanne, jewels glittering in her ruddy hair.</p>

<p>They all stood up and greeted her with a shout.</p>

<p>The massier filled a glass:</p>

<p>&#8220;To the queen&mdash;the victors!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>They all drank to her.</p>

<p>As they sat down, she leaped lightly upon the table; stooped
down; took up a bottle of champagne in each hand, and flinging
wide the amber wine for baptism of victory over the encircling
students, she threw the empty bottle from her. She laughed with
mischievous glee, sent the glass and china flying with sandaled
foot, to clear a space upon the table, and, raising the bottle, bathed
her bare shoulders in the foaming wine before the assembled
company.</p>

<p>There was a call for a dance&mdash;and the orchestra striking up the
quaint pulsing music of a Moorish measure, Suzanne, her feet
stepping it upon the snow-white tablecloth, swung her graceful
way through a strange haunting dance of Arabia.</p>

<p>With slow step and dainty feet that never hurried, the beautiful
young woman strutted, in pride of her body&#8217;s perfection, upon the
white carpet of the tablecloth.</p>

<p>In the shout of applause that greeted her, she skipped deftly
from the table, flung herself upon Noll&#8217;s knees, held up his face,
kissed him, and with &#8220;Thou handsome Englishman!&#8221; she
laughed, put him gaily from her, proudly went her way, and was
lost in the tumultuous throng.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>Noll laughed embarrassedly.</p>

<p>She had set the fashion; on to the tables leaped a score of
models, in fancy dress, and danced among the glasses; the great
revel proceeding with riot and feasting and boisterous merriment.</p>

<p>In the midst of the whirlwind moved Gaston Latour, disguised
in his usual affectation of lugubrious and melancholy seriousness.
He went arrayed as Midnight Alarms&mdash;for trousers he wore a
white shirt, his legs solemnly thrust through the sleeves, the cuffs
fastened about his ankles with enormous brooches for gaudy
sleeve-links, enormous naked indiarubber feet strapped on for
boots. This symbolism of hurried midnight dressing was further
insisted upon by the lady&#8217;s stays that bound the shirt&#8217;s tails about
his waist, his shoulders bare, save for the great hunting-horn over
his chest, and a fireman&#8217;s bucket strapped to the top of his head.
The pretty little model who was with him, dressed solely in a pair
of shoes and Gaston&#8217;s corduroy trousers, the braces holding
them up, strapped over her white shoulders, replenished this
bucket on his head during the evening with heel-taps from
the wine-glasses, so that whilst talking confidentially to
anyone, Gaston gradually lowered his head until the liquor
splashed down upon their faces and trickled down the front of
them&mdash;a result greeted by Gaston with a loud triumphant blare
on the horn.</p>

<p>G√©r√¥me&#8217;s students had drawn their tables into a semicircle; and
before the centre table, where the massier sat, were two young
Frenchmen in the armour of Roman lictors; they were holding
up Ponsonby Wattles Ffolliott under the armpits, whilst he,
dressed as Narcissus, with a bath towel strapped round his loins,
and daffodils in his hair, was drunkenly attempting to make a
speech.</p>

<p>He showed signs of going to sleep, spite of the occasional
shaking up by the lictors; so, amidst loud laughter, they all held
out their hands, thumbs down, and Gaston Latour advancing
from his seat with a soup-tureen, poured a libation of soup over
his hair, and as it trickled down his stupid pallid features, clapped
the tureen on his head; the lictors carried him away and laid him
upon the floor amongst a heap of black bottles, where he settled
to uneasy rest, and mumbled into sleep....</p>

<p>Noll, his strong clean-cut features and his virile youth enhanced
by the severe lines of the Roman helmet with its great framing
steel cheek-pieces, and his well-set body and his shins glittering
in the steel breast-plate and greaves of a classic warrior, sat at
the outermost table of the semicircle. Beside him sat Madelaine,
her white shoulders gleaming as she nestled close to him in the
low-bodiced grey silk dress with great hooped skirt of Velasquez&#8217;s
infantas. Babette, who sat at her other hand, had seized upon
her early in the evening (taking her away without ceremony from
Ffolliott, who was even then in a fuddled state from wine-bibbing),
and Babette had sternly kept the girl by her side
throughout the resulting riot. Indeed, the girl had not needed
much compulsion, for she clung to Babette anxiously, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
little frightened. She was intoxicated with the whirl of her
first ball; and she was very weary of Ffolliott. She was a little
excited with wine, to which she was not accustomed. She was a
little alarmed about Ffolliott&mdash;she had been flattered by his attention
and proud of having caught his eyes a few days before; she
had been thrilled at the prospect of the gown and still more by the
gift of the silken stuff for its making&mdash;and, when she had stood in
it before the mirror, she had realized her wondrous beauty, which
it seemed to have suddenly enhanced and brought to view.</p>

<p>Noll touched her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;who gave you that dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed to the drunken figure of Ffolliott, where he slumbered
amongst the bottles. &#8220;He shall have it back to-morrow&mdash;I
hate him,&#8221; she said passionately; and she leaned against Noll
and nestled close to him.</p>

<p>Babette leant over her and whispered to Noll:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave her so. When the procession forms to start for the
march to the Latin Quarter, I will take her with me,&#8221; she said.
And she added gently: &#8220;I will watch over her as Betty has
watched over me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed sadly, and putting her elbow on the table and her
chin in the pink palm of her hand, she got a-brooding.</p>

<p>Horace Malahide, in the midst of laughter that greeted a sally
of Gaston Latour&#8217;s, turned to her. He leaned over to her, and
looked into her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Babette! serious! and here!&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear fell, and she let it fall unheeding.</p>

<p>Horace put his arm about her slender shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Babette! Has Noll been preaching a sermon?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled sadly, stroked his cheek, and, drawing down his face
to her, she kissed him. He looked such a splendid sunny fellow
in his Roman armour:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear heart,&#8221; she whispered&mdash;&#8220;I, Babette, have been
preaching the sermon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace laughed....</p>

<p>Thus they feasted, danced, and sang until the golden yellow
lights of the great hall paled and became but flickering ghosts of
flame as the sapphire shadow of the night passed away in blue and
purple and lilac before the white dawn. But the students danced
on into the daylight....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last the musicians came down to the floor, and bursting into
a triumphant march, the vast crowd of revellers formed into procession,
and streamed out after the music into the fresh air of the
early morning.</p>

<p>In the streets the early concierges that stood yawning at their
gates, stopped their clacking tongues, cut short their scandals, and
gaped at the din; the street-sweepers rested from their sordid
calling; rag-pickers from their grimy traffic amongst the dust-bins&mdash;for
an invading army, gorgeously apparelled, was taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
possession of Paris, swarming down her thoroughfares in triumphal
splendour, and Bellona, goddess of war, thundered and
rattled and swayed behind, dragged at the tail of the frantic riot.
Street after street, the sleepy city awoke uneasily and put
drowsy heads out of window, vaguely fearful of catastrophe and
dread that the devil of revolution had taken possession of the
place.</p>

<p>As the stream of revellers poured down the heights, they seized
all cabs, and putting their helmets on the heads of the protesting
coachmen, Greek warriors danced wildly on the tops of the cabs,
adding the rattle of wheels and the cracking of whips to the din.</p>

<p>With shout and yell they captured a number of great drays
laden with stone, and pulling down the drivers from their seats
and dispossessing the teamsters, Roman charioteers took the reins
and sent the great horses trotting and pounding clumsily along at
the tail of the gay procession, adding the thunder of their passage
to the tumult.</p>

<p>With song and yell and laughter and skylarking and jovial
horseplay, they burst upon the great square of the Opera, swarmed
up the broad steps, and setting the band in their midst, they took
hands and danced in a mighty circle round and round the
place....</p>

<p>They got moving again, in gorgeous procession, and headed
towards the Louvre, singing student songs, and cheering.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour curdled the blood of passing cabmen by running
out into the road and letting the wheels run over his great indiarubber
feet whilst he yelled in simulated agony. He then threw
himself upon the breast of policemen, and wept bitterly over their
shoulders&mdash;whilst he chalked innuendos across their backs.</p>

<p>With colours flying, band playing, and gorgeous battle-standards
swaying on high, with glint of spears and gleam of armour, the
noisy throng passed through the arches of the old-world palace
of the Louvre and surged into the courtyard, bringing back for
awhile some hint of its ancient magnificence.</p>

<p>The sun arose out of the morning over the edge of the city,
painting with golden glory her heights and upper places, and the
great towers of Notre Dame blushed in his dazzling magnificence,
as, with song and shout and laughter, the youths crossed the river
into the Latin Quarter; and the old quays rang to their merriment
as it has echoed for generations to the familiar riot and reckless
feet of the studentry of this most illustrious university of the
world.</p>

<p>Up the narrow way of the road that is called Buonaparte the
resounding clamour went, until the great gates of the schools of
the Beaux Arts opened and swallowed the gay procession that
trooped into its court&mdash;the gates swung together with a loud
clang, and the orgy spent itself within the staid precincts of the
old courtyard that is set about on its several sides with classic
columns and the faded stateliness of ancient palaces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll halted outside the gates, saw them shut, and took his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
homewards to his high garret; and, as he went, his dress of a
Roman soldier, that had been so appropriate a part of the night&#8217;s
frolic, suddenly became incongruous and ridiculous; and the cold
clear morning&#8217;s light brought a shrewd suspicion that of late he
had been at best somewhat of a tomfool. He mounted the steps
to his garret weary of all this riot&mdash;and there came upon him a
sense of loneliness.</p>

<p>Ay, Noll, to what end has been all this frantic skipping?</p>

<p>Ah, youth! that ever plays the gadabout amidst the strenuous
tomfooleries, with eager chasing of the wild-goose, whilst through
lavish wanton fingers slip unrealized the essential things of life!
Even so did the young Adam, as gossips say, toss away the title-deeds
of Paradise that he might but take a bite at an untried apple.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Youth finds the Cap and Bells to be but a Bizarre Crown</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Noll shut himself in, he felt a little injured that Betty was not
home to greet him. He saw her letter lying on the pillow.</p>

<p>He flung himself upon his bed, drew a rug over him, and slept
until nightfall....</p>

<p>When he awoke, heavy and stiff and chill and bewildered, he
put out his feet into the darkness, and sat for awhile on the side
of the bed, whilst his drowsy brain cleared from the fog of sleep.</p>

<p>He felt somewhat ridiculous in the dress of a Roman soldier.</p>

<p>He shivered. He felt miserable&mdash;he was overwhelmed with a
sense of loneliness. He wondered where Betty was&mdash;and what
doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>No answering sound. There was a ghostly stillness.</p>

<p>He vaguely remembered seeing a letter lying on the bed when
he had lain down to sleep. He put out his hand, and his fingers
struck the envelope. He opened the letter languidly and tried to
read, but the light was gone. He arose stiffly and took it to the
window, but the darkness wholly baffled him.</p>

<p>He searched about for a light, and only found a box of matches
with difficulty. When he had struck the match he realized that
the girl&#8217;s care for him was lacking&mdash;that it had never before been
lacking&mdash;there was no candle or lamp set out for him.</p>

<p>He felt sorry for himself, neglected, aggrieved....</p>

<p>He went back to the bed, sat down upon it, and struck a match;
and by the light of that match he read the opening lines of the
letter. He struck match after match, and by their light he read
to the end of it. And as his hot eyes took in the last words some
of his old dignity came back to him&mdash;he saw that he was sitting
in a tomfool&#8217;s masquerading rags reading the generous deed of
gift of one who refused to be a clog upon him to whom she had
intended only to be an honour and a delight, who asked nothing
of him, who made no complaint, who simply wished that he should
be free, who would not even embarrass him with the initiative of
her dismissal&mdash;who was gone!</p>

<p>And in the darkness he seemed to feel cold hands grope towards
him and clasp icy fingers about his feet; and a whisper spoke in
his ear: &#8220;Thou art alone.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is seen that a Man is More or Less Responsible for his
Father</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll,</span> arriving on Horace&#8217;s landing, found Babette outside the
door; and she was sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Babette?&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;and crying?&#8221;</p>

<p>Babette brushed her fingers across her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; her trembling lips giving her the lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Babette, why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder kindly.</p>

<p>Babette stamped her foot:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>not</i> crying,&#8221; she said; and a large tear fell.... She
made an effort and said: &#8220;Horace is going home.... He is
going&mdash;away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the door, and they went in together.</p>

<p>Noll walked into the studio; but the silken rustle of Babette&#8217;s
skirts passed the door, and hurried on into the darkness of the
house.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the deep dusk of the studio sat four or five figures, smudgy
dark shadows, sprawling in armchairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Noll?&#8221; cried Horace from behind the red spark
where a cigarette glowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I thought you were alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you want me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry, old boy,&#8221; said Noll, and added grimly: &#8220;It
can wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Horace, pushing a chair towards him with
his foot. &#8220;There&#8217;s the bottle by you&mdash;and a glass&mdash;and the dried
cabbage of Egypt. Set it ablaze and talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace struck a match on the seat of his breeches as Noll flung
into the chair, and handed the flame to him; and Noll, setting the
light to a cigarette, saw the faces of Bartholomew Doome and four
of the Five Foolish Virgins in the gloom.</p>

<p>The light went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your room&#8217;s all dismantled, Horace,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Horace&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m off home. I was just sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Jonkin with a note to tell you. I&#8217;m giving my farewell feast of
departure to-morrow night&mdash;next day I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Horace shifted uneasily in his chair; and then he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s become chairman of his newspaper company;
and he&#8217;s going to give an address to a learned society on the
Dignity of Literature.... I can&#8217;t stand that.... After all,
one is more or less responsible for one&#8217;s father.... Indeed, the
drawback of having a father is that he has the right to bear the
same name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Noll&mdash;I know. They call him the Napoleon of the
Press in the newspapers. In his own newspapers ... yes,&#8221; said
Horace drily; and added judicially, making every allowance
for the defendant: &#8220;Of course, the old gentleman <i>may</i> be the
Napoleon of the Press&mdash;perhaps he is. I don&#8217;t see why I should
wrangle about that. And I&#8217;m bound to say that, since they called
him so, he has shaved off his city whiskers and keeps his hand
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, and pretends to think a
lot, and isn&#8217;t so beastly familiar with millionaires. He wanted to
wear a grey overcoat last winter, but I had to draw the line. You
see, the old man has no flare for the subtleties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doome coughed in the darkness:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you break it to him, Horace?&#8221; he asked drily.</p>

<p>Horace pshawed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him he couldn&#8217;t do it&mdash;he&#8217;d be getting into a damned
black cocked hat next,&#8221; he sighed heavily: &#8220;I hate to be rude to
my father,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;it always hurts me more than it does him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think, Horace,&#8221; said Noll, &#8220;that you make allowances
for your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s something in that,&#8221; said Horace. &#8220;However,
we&#8217;ll allow that the old gentleman is the Napoleon of the Press.
And of course he and the mother are in the thick of life. Indeed,
the mother&#8217;s gowns are always described in the morning
paper after a big social function&mdash;and, by St. Paquin, it&#8217;s extraordinary
how well they sound in <i>print</i>; yet&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how it
is&mdash;for she is a comely woman&mdash;but when you put a gold ornament
upon my mother it looks like brass&mdash;she&#8217;s one of those women who,
when she hangs diamonds round her neck, looks like a ball-room
chandelier. She&#8217;s as sound as the apostles beneath her stays,
but she has about as much taste as a housemaid&mdash;or the House of
Brunswick. Then, the old gentleman dines with old Lord Bardolph
Nankhill&mdash;sits at meat with Cabinet Ministers&mdash;and has
been seen at Marlborough House. All that, of course, cannot do
him any real harm. But&mdash;the Dignity of Literature! and to a
learned society! No ... it can&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Doome. &#8220;Society accepts the words of an
associate of Cabinet Ministers in a Tory Government as revelation
sent direct from God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; scoffed Horace. &#8220;If learned societies want hints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
about the commercialism of the Press, the traffic in brains, then
pa&#8217;s the man of whom to ask advice&mdash;but the Dignity of Letters!
Good God!... An English newspaper should look like a gentleman&#8217;s
property. The <i>Times</i> is a journal that ought to be in every
gentleman&#8217;s waste-paper basket. It&#8217;s always wrong&mdash;but it is
magnificently wrong. It is consistent. To vote at the polls on
the advice of the <i>Times</i> is almost to make a virtue of vice. To
vote against it is to come near to statesmanship and is the first
principle of political honour. But this newspaper of the father&#8217;s
is sometimes right, only in such bad taste. He has taken the
whole look of distinction from the daily broadsheet.... He
has vulgarized the printed page. The very print cries out against
him. He has debased the manners of journalism until they are
as coarse as the traffic in manures, as ignoble as money-lending, as
truthful as a company-promoter&#8217;s prospectus, as ponderous in wit
and humour as an American advertisement, its political, artistic,
social and all other ideals as high as the imagination of shop-walkers.
He has even vulgarized the word Empire. The people
whom he employs but scrape a living, and they therefore give of
their worst&mdash;the consequence is the employment of illiterate and
unscrupulous cads in what ought to be one of the noblest and most
accomplished and most sacred of callings, the enlightenment of
the nation.... Tshah! in his hands the magazine has become
a thing of shame&mdash;filled with illustrations that are a public misfortune....
No. My father is a millionaire. He has grown
rich&mdash;that is all. Pa is a very good fellow; but he don&#8217;t know
anything about the Dignity of Letters. I must go home. This
thing cannot be done&mdash;it cannot be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll, finding Horace taken up with his own affairs, felt shy of
telling him his trouble; and it was borne in upon him sadly
enough that his friend was leaving him, and had to be about his
own business&mdash;far away from him at the very time he most
wanted his sympathy. An overwhelming sense of loneliness
came upon him, and the silence was profound.</p>

<p>The melancholy sense of coming departure&mdash;of the breaking up
of old pleasant associations, of the passing out from their midst of
a congenial and blithe companion and a happy face&mdash;set them all
brooding.</p>

<p>It was abundantly clear that Horace Malahide was being
packed; for the valet, who had always before been hidden,
though never far away, could now be heard in the next room
brushing clothes and buzzing at the business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Horace, rousing&mdash;&#8220;by the way, you fellows will
want mourning for my feast of departure to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned towards the door beneath which gleamed a yellow
streak of candle-light:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jonkin!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>The door opened, and in the golden glory of the doorway stood
the ineffable Jonkin. He was dressed like a student, short black
coat, big black tie, velvet waistcoat, corduroy trousers and all;
but the dignity of the gentleman&#8217;s gentleman glowed within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring those boxes of black kid gloves, black neckties, and the
crape for these gentlemen to choose from,&#8221; said Horace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221; said Jonkin.</p>

<p>He brought the cardboard boxes with stealthy walk, and handed
them about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jonkin,&#8221; said Horace&mdash;&#8220;is everything packed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The serious baggage is all ready, sir,&#8221; said Jonkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to take it all away the very first thing in the
morning, and get it out of sight and off to London before the men
arrive to drape the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing about the place here after to-morrow morning but
what will go into my oldest and most battered bullock-trunk and
my portmanteau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you understand you are not to leave any silver-mounted
things about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and Jonkin&mdash;reserve me a first-class carriage by the next
morning&#8217;s boat-train for Boulogne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be in it yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With my dressing things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And English clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go as far as Amiens third class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;and Jonkin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a beastly row in the railway-station and I&#8217;m in it,
for God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t look anxious, or as if you belong to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Jonkin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> light of many candles set in a row along the white napery of
the table showed but dimly in the large room, for the walls were
hung with the sombre black cloth hangings that are drawn across
the doors of churches in honour of the dead. The glint on plate
and china and glass was chastened and modified by the solemn
blackness of decorating black ribbons&mdash;large black bows upon the
gilt necks of black bottles of champagne, narrow black bows upon
the handles of knives and forks and stems of drinking glasses,
and round salt-cellar and mustard-pot and cruet and centre dish.
The menus were printed on large black-edged mourning-cards.
Flower-bowls had given place to the painted wreaths of wire
flowers that are placed in graveyards. The tablecloth was strewn
with dead leaves.</p>

<p>The black figures of the waiters, who stood in solemn row to
either side of the table, tricked out in the gloomy garb of hearse-lackeys,
melted into the darkness behind them except for their
pale faces, which caught the up-flung light from the candles that
played upon chin and nostril and eye-pits, and sent shadows up
their features, pronouncing the frown of expectancy with which
they waited for the belated guests.</p>

<p>There was a loud blare; a hunting-horn without began to bray
the Dead March in <i>Saul</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221; said a waiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; growled the head waiter.</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and Horace entered in black, wearing
black kid gloves, and followed by Gaston Latour, also in mourning
and black kid gloves, blowing all the emotion of which he was
master into the resounding brass of the great wind instrument
that encircled his chest. And as the guests trooped in after them,
all in black and wearing black kid gloves, students and their young
womenfolk all taking their seats at the table with a titter, Gaston
Latour solemnly tramped round the room behind the waiters in
slow step, blaring the march of the dead, taking his lips from the
brass mouthpiece only to imitate the roll of the kettle-drums and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
to give the big drum&#8217;s solemn announcement of doom with a loud
&#8220;boom!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Horace had seen them all seated, he sat down.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the vigorous lead given by Gaston Latour, the
jests did not come tripping to the call; laughter lost something of
its hilarity; tongues that were wont to wag with airy wit were
barren of banter; voices had a tendency to huskiness; quip and
crank gave way to tales of the days that were gone&mdash;so they
feasted for awhile with something of the fever gone out of their
riot, and until the coffee came they sat unwontedly staid and
hushed, and in reminiscence and story lived again their insolences
and their rebuffs, their darings and their hesitations, their enthusiasms
and their hardships, their glorious comradeships, their
hero-worship, and their fantastic revelries....</p>

<p>It was near midnight when a skull was passed round filled with
little folded papers, and they cast lots for Horace&#8217;s corduroy
trousers. Gaston won the breeches, and had to deliver the funeral
oration.</p>

<p>He stood up, pulled on his black kid gloves, and blew his nose
strenuously, taking a long-sustained and melancholy note that
sent a titter round the solemn row of waiters:</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends of my youth, companions of my unmitigated follies!
the ancient figure that sits at the head of this table was once
young&mdash;the years cannot rob him of that. And it is because he
has not been ashamed to share his youngness with the lion and the
ass that I rise to-night to bid you drink to the Passing of Youth
in the mirth-provoking wines of France. This is the last mad
moment of his splendid years; to-night his heroic follies are done;
this room, where have been revelry and dance and song and wit
and laughter and boon companionship, will know him no more.
He is called home&mdash;across the sea-sick channel. He goes to
shiver forlorn amidst the gloomy fogs of respectability. He will
marry a staid wife and beget staid children and dine with lord
mayors and wear white waistcoats over a self-conscious stomach.
With the corduroy breeches of his studentship he has no more to
do. Whither he goes there are no gay caf√©s&mdash;no riotous junketings.
He will dance down the streets no more&mdash;shout no more&mdash;to
the stars no more. Whither he goes the people are glum,
grey-minded, commonplace&mdash;he must not sing, except out of
tune, or monotonously, for fear of sin in the music&mdash;he must not
dance, except with pre-arranged precision and with demure one,
two, three to tunes that are piously bereft of all ecstasy. Revelry
he will pass by with averted glance and eyes downcast. And yet,
as he sits at his plethoric ease before the fire, after a full dinner,
prosperous, rotund, bourgeois, he will nod, and nodding sleep&mdash;and
in the freedom of dreams his ranging memory, rid for awhile
of its crude discipline, will flit here, back to the old room, back to
the bare walls&mdash;he will live again the blithe days of his fantastic
youth; he will hear the echo of old laughter as his old jests set
the ghosts of his old companions in a roar about the table; at
break of day, as the mists rise from the river, he will skip down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Boule Miche, the highway of youth; he will caper through the
dawn to blow out the stars above Montparnasse; he will recall
with a glow and a bracing of the nerves that he was acquainted
with hardship and scarce knew it, for the streets were paved with
gladness, and kind eyes made stars in his firmament on the blackest
of nights, and he lodged amongst the skies&mdash;and in Paris....
Fill your glasses, comrades, and drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all rose to their feet.</p>

<p>Latour raised his glass:</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man!&#8221; said he, with meaning accent on the threadbare
words; and &#8220;Old man!&#8221; cried they all, laughing, with a sob in
the laugh.</p>

<p>Horace rose, when they sat down, telling them that he could not
trust himself to speak otherwise than to say that it warmed his
heart as it grieved his heart that he found himself seated amongst
his dear companions for the last time in his old room. He raised
his glass to Youth, to the comrades of youth, to the students&#8217;
quarter, to the university, to the Boule Miche which was the highway
of youth, to the great dead, to Paris, to France.</p>

<p>They all stood up and drank the toast in solemn silence; and
Horace standing there at the head of his table, they each passed
by, handing him a keepsake for remembrance, grasped his hand,
and after a husky greeting, strode out of the room.</p>

<p>Babette was the last to go. She went up to Horace, drew down
his face between her white hands, and kissed him upon the mouth.
He stroked her head; they spake never a word. Her eyes
filled with tears, and she hastily followed the others out of the
room.</p>

<p>Horace was left alone with the solemn waiters.</p>

<p>He stood for awhile, too much touched to speak.</p>

<p>He roused himself at last with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The old head waiter came to him.</p>

<p>Horace held out his hand and grasped the shy hand of the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean,&#8221; said Horace&mdash;&#8220;you are an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>Horace took a banknote from his pocket and flung it on the
table:</p>

<p>&#8220;Divide that amongst the waiters,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and, Jean, give
this to your good wife&mdash;it will help little Marie to her dowry.&#8221;
He handed the man a crisp banknote; and the old fellow&#8217;s eyes
filled with tears....</p>

<p>As the door closed on Horace, one of them laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, mon Dieu!&#8221; said he drily&mdash;&#8220;that they should ever grow
wise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; roared the old waiter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horace, as he passed through the doorway, was greeted by
Gaston Latour:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must skip down the highway of youth for the last time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Horace,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You must once again eat the dawn on the
Boule Miche. Forward, comrades!&#8221;</p>

<p>They, all hatted and cloaked, flung his cloak over his shoulders,
set his black slouch hat upon his head, and together tramped down
the stairs and out into the street; and, linking arms, the students
and their young women strolled along the roadway and made for
the Boule Miche, singing a rousing student song&mdash;the dark and
deserted street echoing to the racket.</p>

<p>They came out on the Place St. Michel, took hands, and in the
dim moonlight they danced in a wide ring before the fountain in
the wall where in his niche the bronze saint slays the dragon at the
threshold of the student&#8217;s world.</p>

<p>Out of breath, they went and leaned over the parapet of the
bridge of St. Michel, and then one sighed, and silence fell upon
them all.</p>

<p>Out of the flood loomed the great towers of the Cathedral of
Notre Dame, and low down and beyond twinkled the lights of the
Morgue; and, beyond all, the waters of the river swirled into the
mists sweeping on to the restless sea&mdash;out into the night and the
eternal mystery.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour leading, they clambered down to the river&#8217;s
edge; and they sprinkled Horace with the waters of the Seine,
and made him for ever a citizen of Paris.</p>

<p>Up they all clambered again, scaled the parapet, and joining
hands, along the Boule Miche they went, singing&mdash;now forming a
ring to dance round embarrassed policemen, now pounding
shutters with their fists, greeting with a cheer the sleepy heads
that were thrust out of open windows, blinking anxiously down
into the night; and with these and the like tomfooleries, saluting
the closed caf√©s where they had held their many light-hearted
revels, they reached the garden of the Luxembourg&mdash;stood
before the Pantheon&mdash;in the paling night they uncovered to the
great dead. Thus silent, Horace stood for the last time as a
student on the heights of Montparnasse. The immensity of the
night was passing in purple majesty into the western heavens;
and beyond, where the students&#8217; highway topped the hill, in the
smoky twilight glittered the morning star.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein a Comely Young Woman broods upon the Years</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Horace</span> shook hands with them all amidst their hearty promises
to come and see him off, bade them good-night, and climbed the
dark stairs to his rooms.</p>

<p>He pushed open the door of his studio to find the room possessed
by the sombre twilight of the dawn. The heavy curtains
that had hung across the great windows had been flung open, and
the beginnings of light showed the deserted banquet, discovering
a young woman who sat at the table, her face buried in her arms.</p>

<p>Horace shut the door gently and went and sat down beside her;
took off his black hat; flung it on the table; and, leaning towards
her, his golden hair touching her dark masses, he put his hand
upon her pretty head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Babette,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She raised her head wearily, and leaning her elbow on the table,
she set her dainty chin in her hand, and wiped the tears hurriedly
from her eyes. She gazed moodily before her.</p>

<p>Horace took her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Babette?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I fill your heart with my sadness, Horace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Babette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking of the days that are gone, Horace&mdash;you
have always been very gentle with me.... And&mdash;I have been
thinking of the days that are to come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips trembled; and a tear stole down her cheek.</p>

<p>Horace nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Babette&mdash;and of the days to come!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been wondering whether you will think of me,
Horace&mdash;as the days pass. I have been wondering&mdash;wondering&mdash;wondering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Babette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Babette,&#8221; he said; and he stroked her hair, gazing
at her hungrily.</p>

<p>She uttered a little sob.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>&#8220;Hush, Babette,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited a little while:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have loved thee for love, Horace.&#8221; She smiled sadly and
stroked his hand. &#8220;Must I love now for livelihood?... To
me the moonlight nights by lake and river can never be the nights
they have been with thee. And he who walks beside me must
needs feel it so.... You go home, Horace, to life&mdash;I go on here,
growing old, year by year. I have been sitting here in the dark,
peering at the years. One day the gaiety will go out of my heart,
the freshness out of my looks, the colour out of my face, the light
out of my eyes. Men turn and look at me now&mdash;their eyes smile
at me. The time will come when men&#8217;s eyes will pass me by.
Students in the Boule Miche will say, &#8216;She was some clever fellow&#8217;s
mistress&mdash;once.&#8217; And there will be laughter. So, one day I shall
sit at the tables&mdash;alone; my only prospect&mdash;the grave. Yet&mdash;with
some&mdash;memories.... My haggard eyes have been staring
at these things all through the long night, and the disillusioning
dawn has but confirmed the nightmare.... Yet, Horace, dear
heart, I have done nothing to deserve it&mdash;except in loving thee
... except in loving thee, dear heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears brimmed over her eyelids, and her voice was stayed
in a sob.</p>

<p>Horace took her tear-wet face between his hands and kissed her
upon the eyes and mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Babette,&#8221; said he hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;thou hast wept thy
last and thy only tears for any harshness from me. Dost thou
think, dear heart, that I who have never found thee guilty of the
smallest meanness will leave thee alone because, forsooth, thou
hast loved me well! Dost thou think that thy dear hands and
thy sight and thy breath and thy hearing and thy sweet bosom
are not become a part of me! Tush! we have been married
these many months. In a month from now thou must go through
the law&#8217;s farce with me&mdash;but thou art my very wife&mdash;thou canst
be no more to me than that, nor I to thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Horace&mdash;thou hadst better leave me. It would be a jibe
against thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; He laughed huskily. &#8220;Thy train and steamboat
passage are bought hours ago&mdash;there is a room preparing for thee
in my father&#8217;s house.... Thou canst surely bear to be a maid
again for thirty days!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, and flung her arms about him and kissed his hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;I love thee, fool,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and will share thy folly....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Horace&mdash;&#8220;the room is full of light&mdash;the sun will
soon be peeping over the roofs. We must be packing. I have
kept my best trunk for thy belongings, Babette.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take no time&mdash;I have as little wardrobe as dowry to
bring thee, Horace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always look so well, Babette,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I had not
realized thou hadst not even a trunk till the night before last....
Thou must be at the Louvre as early as the big shops open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
this morning, and buy all thou canst buy of gowns and kickshaws
in an hour.... It will save thee from fretting upon the
hardship of thy life with me, Babette, until we leave. Where is
thy purse?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and handed him her light purse.</p>

<p>He bulged it out with banknotes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou must spend all this in gowns,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She took the notes and unfolded them upon the table:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but, Horace, this will buy me many silk gowns&mdash;we
must not waste&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her, and laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot to tell thee about the insignificant things&mdash;we are
rich, Babette.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears came into her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;I shall shame thee, Horace&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her quivering lips to silence her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then God send me shame, Babette,&#8221; he said; and he added,
with a twinkle in his laughing eyes: &#8220;My sisters will judge thee
largely by thy clothes, so buy for thyself as thou wouldst buy for
my honour and my credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed gaily; then a frown knit the handsome brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Babette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only an hour to buy a trousseau!&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;An hour
is such a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed loud and long; and she laughed at his laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Babette,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;no, no, not thy wedding-dresses.
Buy just thy few gowns to fill my trunk. Thou wouldst not rob
my sisters of a month&#8217;s shopping, thou selfish egoist. They are
rich&mdash;and must have employment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not find gowns that will fit me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy needle will do the fitting.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat, the happy tears in her handsome eyes, her hand in his,
and gazed at the coming day.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;thou wouldst weep!&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed his fingers, put her dainty palm on his lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing thy sisters&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am taking thee home, Babette, to teach my sisters manners,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;And thy father, Horace?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hands on her slender shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Babette,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I have told my father you are of the De
la Rues of Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed gaily.</p>

<p>He frowned at her in mock solemnity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou must not laugh at that jest before my father,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;My father believes in the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Nobility and Me. It&#8217;s his only creed. Thou must never shake
a man&#8217;s religious faith, my Babette. And he will love thee, with
his rough love&mdash;for thou art very beautiful&mdash;and&mdash;thou lovest me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>She slipped her hand through his arm, and nestled her face
close to his:</p>

<p>&#8220;Horace,&#8221; she said simply&mdash;&#8220;I will tell thee now what I had
intended to tell thee never: there is a little one coming&mdash;a little
child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was filled with a great silence and wonder.</p>

<p>He sat holding her slender fingers and gazing at her shy eyes.
He put out his hand and placed it upon her breasts:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if it usurp my place and oust me from thy fragrant
bosom?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She laughed a low happy laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Horace; that would be fearful,&#8221; she said in gay raillery,
&#8220;for thou mightest then treat the little one as harshly as thou
hast used me....&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they thou&#8217;d and thee&#8217;d and kissed and kissed again, until
the sun peeped in over the eastern window&#8217;s ledge, and touched
the young man&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>She put her hand upon his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art pure gold,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which treats of a Harmless Riot amongst such as Dwell on Mount
Parnassus</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Horace</span> descended from Mount Parnassus in a whirlwind. Indeed,
he had a keen sense for the becomingness of things. He was the
poor student to the end. He departed from Bohemia in the
tattered habit of Bohemia and after the fashion of Bohemia&mdash;indeed,
it was splendid poverty.</p>

<p>The courtyard swarmed with students, and Gaston Latour
stood solemnly directing the devilries, his pale face more than
usually tricked with gloom, his dreamy poetic eyes dark with
melancholy, his lips sounding blood-curdling ear-splitting blares
upon his hunting-horn, regardless of all the municipal laws against
the use of the same except at public festivals. The place was
astir with chatter and laughter and fool&#8217;s play and the coming
and going of feet.</p>

<p>In the midst of the ferment, Horace and others were securing
his baggage to a handcart, the embarrassed porter standing to one
side, his hands itching to do the roping.</p>

<p>A loud blare from Latour&#8217;s hunting-horn&mdash;and there was
silence.</p>

<p>Horace strode up to the fat concierge, who stood on the steps
with her three small children, the better to see the sights. He
lifted each of the little ones, gave them a hug, and setting them
down on the steps again, slipped a large silver piece into the small
fingers. He took off his hat, and kissed the jolly old woman upon
the cheek before them all, and slipped a hundred-franc note into
her rough toil-worn hand. The little ones began to cry, and the
concierge, the tears in her eyes, told them not to be stupid.</p>

<p>Horace patted them on the head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming back to play with you, you lazy little rascals,&#8221;
said he; and putting on his hat, he pulled it well over his eyes.</p>

<p>He strode over to the handcart, and at a sign from him, they
seized the porter and hove his expostulating bulk a-top of the
baggage, where he was compelled to sit for the remainder of the
journey across Paris to the railway-station of the north, in embarrassed
discomfort; and Horace getting between the shafts, a
bevy of students set the light rattling affair moving on clattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
wheels, and the noisy party, pushing, pulling, and hauling and
bawling, marched out of the courtyard in escort amidst the waving
of handkerchiefs from windows and the last farewells.</p>

<p>A fussy burgess, put to the wall with some indignity by the
stream of careless students, went up to a group of police and reminded
them that the hunting-horn was not allowed to be blown
in Paris except on certain high festivals.</p>

<p>His venom was wasted.</p>

<p>The police shrugged amused shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said they&mdash;&#8220;but it is only the students....&#8221;</p>

<p>As they came into the Boule Miche, singing the National
Anthem, the landlords of the taverns and caf√©s and the white-aproned
waiters came out to their doors, and greeted the noisy
crew&mdash;indeed, Horace was well known, and his genial ways and
amiable personality robbed him of all enemies.</p>

<p>Horace, amid handshakings down the street, foreseeing that
the catching of the train was becoming a nice question and thinking
Babette looked pale, took advantage of a moment&#8217;s breathing-space
to whisper to the girl that she had better drive off to warn
his man Jonkin that they might be late; and Babette was glad
to get into a passing fiacre and slip away. Her heart was too full
for jesting that had tears in the jest.</p>

<p>The noisy crew got the handcart on the run as soon as they
crossed the river, the jolted porter a-top, but rattled up the Rue
la Fayette in none too good time; as they dashed into the great
station the bustle of departure that comes before the leaving of
the boat-train was at its noisy height.</p>

<p>The officials were quite unable to cope with the students, who,
chaffing them, rushed and swarmed over the barriers and took possession
of the platform.</p>

<p>The man at the barrier laughed, shrugged shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only the students,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour, gloomily dancing the <i>danse de ventre</i> on the
platform, was assailed by a pompous fussy little man in
uniformed authority, who alone displayed sufficient lack of tact
to interfere with the young bloods. Gaston stooped down;
solemnly stroked the official protruding paunch, and putting his
ear thereto, said &#8220;Cough!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sulky fellow growled threats:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; said Gaston&mdash;&#8220;he is wasting away!&#8221;</p>

<p>The surly fellow made as if to go.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour grabbed him and listened at his stomach again:</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a bad heart,&#8221; he said; flung his arms round his neck,
and crying over his shoulder hysterically, he wailed melancholy
sobs down the great hunting-horn. He had a grotesque
mind....</p>

<p>And thus, amidst frantic foolings and warm hand-grippings and
promises of early return, the train steamed slowly out of the huge
station, taking Horace away from the days of his youth&mdash;for he
had realized during the night that was gone that manhood was
come upon him.</p>

from the noisy crowd of departing students that strolled chattering
and jocular from the scene of their leave-taking. He walked
home alone.</p>

<p>When he climbed to his room, the loneliness yawned at him out
of the void of the empty place. Every shadow, every chair, the
bed, the whole deserted place, whispered that Betty was gone.</p>

<p>He moved restlessly about his rooms all day, chafed and fretted,
and, when the twilight fell, he as aimlessly fidgeted out into the
dusk and betook himself to the streets of Paris.</p>

<p>And as he strode moodily along, nagging whispers went with
him&mdash;unpleasant questionings nudged at his elbow&mdash;irking discomfort
plucked at his sleeve.</p>

<p>He had very clearly realized during the last few days that, good
fellows as they were, Horace and his companions were all taken
up with their own affairs&mdash;that they were really only genially
interested in him in relation to themselves&mdash;that he was interested
in them in relation to himself. Not a soul had asked a word
about Betty. He resented it&mdash;yet he knew that his neglect of
her alone had been the beginning of her being set aside from their
ken. If he felt so of a sudden about their neglect of her, what
must she have felt about his neglect of her? God, how he had
let her drop out of everything!</p>

<p>He knew now that his one selfless friend had been this girl&mdash;this
handsome dainty woman. And he had let her go out into
the dusk, alone&mdash;leaving him alone.</p>

<p>And for what?</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>It came to him now, a whisper in his ear, that her brain was
worth all the wits of all these others put together. It was revealed
to him that most of the keenly observant, large, and
humane phrases that had sounded the music of well-spoken insight
to his understanding had been hers.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he realized what an appalling obstacle his indifference
to her confidences about her work must have been! Indifference?
Nay, he had shown a harsher snarl than that. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
a chill to her enthusiasms and to the practice of her craft must
have been all his silent discouragement&mdash;or lack of encouragement....
Stay&mdash;had it even been silent? There had been his
ill-concealed impatience with the patience of her building. Had
there not indeed been hints without disguise about her work being
long enough in the doing? He could have cut out his tongue for
its jeer about priggish dilatoriness and Casauban&#8217;s <i>Key to all the
Mythologies</i>. His ill-manners and his neglect struck him in the
face, and he shrank from it now with a burning sense of shame&mdash;his
face scalded. What would he not have given to recall the
shabby jibe!</p>

<p>He turned into a caf√© and was greeted with a shout. And in
the resulting rolic, for several hours, he forgot his self-recriminations.
But in the black night, taking himself homewards, it
struck him like a buffet upon the mouth delivered out of the surrounding
darkness. He had lacked manhood.</p>

<p>Reaching his rooms, a dozen petty discomforts assailed him to
remind him of the mother-care and gentle hands that no longer
showed their tenderness&mdash;on striking a light, the stealthy shadows
stole away skulkingly into the corners, mocking at his loneliness,
nudging elbows at him.</p>

<p>He lit a candle, and sat down on the side of his bed.</p>

<p>It was borne in upon him, sitting there in solitary communion
with his own unmitigated selfishness, that the man alone is not a
human entity.</p>

<p>Ay, Noll; thou art not the only numbskull&mdash;the very nations
share thy cap and bells. Man is indeed incomplete without the
woman. Any scheme of life that eliminates the woman is a futile
scheme of life. The human animal is not one, but two&mdash;man without
woman is wholly incomplete, a crudity, inadequate, a fatuity,
and hence a thing of shame.</p>

<p>Nay, the lad had glimmerings into depths deeper than that;
gazing at the naked truth of things, it came to him that any scheme
of life wherein the woman is made inferior degrades the man with
her degradation, since she is a part of him&mdash;and a part of a man
in a state of humiliation humiliates the whole of him.</p>

<p>He wondered what she was doing; whether they were being
kind to the sensitive, large-hearted, dainty Betty.</p>

<p>A sob caught at his throat. He knew&mdash;with a hot flush he
knew&mdash;it was the first generous thought that had moved him
these many days. He had been pitying himself like a whipped
cur, the which never yet brought a man honour or comfort or
dignity.</p>

<p>Wo-hee-ho-ho! moaned the scoffing wind without.</p>

<p>What was she doing&mdash;out there&mdash;in the dark?</p>

<p>Ah, Noll&mdash;what, indeed?</p>

<p>The very shadows bent to hear.</p>

<p>But, Ho-ho-hey! scoffed the mocking wind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero dabbles his Hands in the Turgid Waters of Philosophy,
and brings up Some Grains of Truth from a Pebbly
Bottom. A Chapter that the Frivolous would do well to skip&mdash;the
Ironies being infrequent, if not wholly wanting; and the
Humours lacking in the Comic Interest</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> days Noll fretted restlessly about his room and the streets of
the city.</p>

<p>He went back to his old haunts&mdash;to the practice of his assiduous
idlenesses. But the fever had gone out of his pleasant habits;
and the talk of his fellows was become stale.</p>

<p>He lingered on&mdash;lonesomely but doggedly.</p>

<p>So the days passed into weeks; the weeks stole away the
months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll could not shake off a strange sense of humiliation. Shrug
his shoulders as he might at the pathetic silence that had taken
the place of Betty&#8217;s mellow voice, humiliation nudged elbows with
him, peered into his frowning eyes, was not to be rebuffed by his
sullen face. He was a prey to self-contempt. The devil of regret
takes hard snubbing. And no man lies intelligently to his own
conscience.</p>

<p>He took refuge in letters.</p>

<p>This galling humiliation had set him soul-searching....
Rudderless, aimless, floating on the sea of pleasant tides, he now
gazed in tribulation at gulfs that yawned before him and about
him and beyond&mdash;the Whence and the Why and the Whither of
this Present Seeming. And as the learning of old spent itself in
the search for the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, so the virile imagination
of youth, steeping itself in written wisdom, went a-questing for
the secret of life.</p>

<p>Everywhere, where men thought at all and were not content
with hereditary thinking, the whole concept of life was being
shaken to its base. The barbaric Eastern statement of an all-powerful,
all-seeing, all-creating, all-wise God as a huge blundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
image of man, taken up with the essaying of experiments, was
a fatuous contradiction that mocked at the majesty of the secret
of life. Inspiration that cannot face the truth is not saved thereby,
but wholly inadequate; indeed, the first aim of a lie is to
evade the truth.</p>

<p>Rejecting the crude and garish guesses, the untenable dogma,
the juggling conventions of theology, the young fellow had, with
the confidence of youth, relied on the intellect for the solution of
the problem of life. Indeed, it is abundantly clear that out of
the base metal of untruth, at any rate, the key to the great
mysteries of life shall not be forged. So, rightly looking to
knowledge as an essential element in the search for the key to
the secret of life, the youth had gone further and looked to the
intellect to be that key&mdash;only to find himself in a blind alley with
museums at end. The intellect but labelled and pigeon-holed the
facts of life in this museum of consciousness. But he had stumbled
in solemn company enough&mdash;a goodly bevy of the world&#8217;s philosophers
stood bewildered in the same chill marble place&mdash;the
labels were all strictly accurate, but the specimens were dead.</p>

<p>Whatever the answer to the riddle of the world, man&#8217;s only key
is through the doors of the intellect and of the senses. Suspicious
of the senses, the youth had relied implicitly on the intellect. It
came to him now that the uttermost truth, the secret of life, was
beyond man&#8217;s reason.</p>

<p>Indeed, the priest who thunders the loudest against agnosticism
is the greatest agnostic of them all&mdash;who, asked for the absolute
details that lie beyond the grave, must give for answer, robbed
of all vague talk of God and devil and heavens and hells, &#8220;I know
not.&#8221; Nay, when reason outsteps his theologic acceptances, is
he not first to stab at reason? The theologian clamours for the
law; but his statements of the law are the veriest guesses. The
solemn law of one generation may be the laughing-stock of the
next&mdash;the crimes of the further next. The idols of one church
are the derision of another. Men have been burnt for cast-iron
gods by others whose sole claim to godliness was in the lacking
humour to laugh at cast-iron gods.</p>

<p>If there be a God, His majesty shall not be sought in a noisy
and blundering travesty of Man. Good Master Paley touched the
sublime humour when he made the world designed for man&mdash;wholly
forgetting even the fleas.</p>

<p>Indeed, the veriest savage can show the titles to his most brutal
savageries in guesses, when all&#8217;s said.</p>

<p>And this very solid world that wounds the stumbling foot, is it
not but an idea to each? the solid reality dying for us in our
dying&mdash;to the flab jelly-fish this splendid wayfaring being even
in the living not wholly of the same seeming as to you and me and
the other.</p>

<p>Yet wholly and absolutely sure are we that all is. Whatever
madness possess us, we know the Achievement. For he who
splits hairs with his reason, and affirms that nothing exists,
except in our imagination, is like to him who thrusts his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
against a stone wall; and will find that the wall and his thinking-machinery
are, but do not matter. There is no gain in juggling
with facts. Matter is matter, and life is life, and denial but
denial.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the intellect has in it no creative power, no
vitalizing essence&mdash;cannot give life. The meaning of life must
be lived. Nay, knowledge of the intellect is not even the incentive
to life&mdash;not so much as instigator of our most paltry acts.
The instincts and the emotions and intuition are the more vigorous
masters and compellers of our living&mdash;are outside knowledge&mdash;independent
of it&mdash;often opposed to it, overwhelming it,
setting it aside at slightest desire carelessly, contemptuously,
passionately.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The brutes of the field have not reason; yet are they moved by
this same mystery of life; their flame goes out in the same strange
mystery of death! That which is the secret of life in man must
also be the secret of life in all else....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The youth had been overwhelmed in the darkness that had
shown beyond the impotence of the intellect. He was aroused
by the literature of Romanticism. He opened the book of the
wisdom of Schopenhauer; it led to the page of life to which he
had now turned. The German pointed a guiding finger.</p>

<p>Even if the brain&#8217;s ken were not limited, it is impotent. But,
fortunately, there is a secret stair to the mystery of life. Not
by way of the intellect, but by way of the emotions may we pierce
to the secret of existence. Life expresses itself through the
senses. The emotions hold more of the ultimate mystery than
all the vapour-filled brains of philosophers, be they priest or
schoolmaster&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The youth thought he had discovered the answer to the riddle
of life.</p>

<p>Searching deep down into his own being, frankly, with the unembarrassed
gaze of himself for sole company, fearlessly, candidly,
and in the decent silence, peering for the innermost essence of
existence, he perceived throughout all seeming incongruities and
inconsistencies and warnings, a strange all-compelling energy
which this snarling Schopenhauer called the Will to Live&mdash;a blind,
never-resting, never-satisfied want&mdash;a fierce desire for life.</p>

<p>He saw that the body is but the earthly habitation for the use
of this mystic breath of life whereby alone may life achieve its
compelling urging for the fulness of experience. The intellect
was wonderful, as were all the body&#8217;s functions; heart and belly
and the rest; but it and they were only the instruments by which
the inspiration of life protected itself from destruction, guiding
itself through the dangers that beset it in the substantial world
or threatened its continuance&mdash;through pain shrinking from
the dangers of destruction; through pleasure moving forward
eagerly towards a fuller experience; through hope which encourages,
and fear which makes to hesitate; through love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
which draws it to its fellows and its mate, and hate which warns
it of its enemies&mdash;for in marriage is continuance and evolving,
in hate is denying. Thus fares the sensate vehicle of the body,
enabling life to destroy its foes, above all to realize manifold
emotions, and to hand itself on with an added heritage of experience
to a higher wayfaring.</p>

<p>Everywhere was absolute confirmation. Science, all that was
known of the solid world, confirmed it. Experience confirmed it.
History confirmed it. The senses confirmed it. Instinct confirmed
it. Everywhere, in all, common to man and brute, was
this overwhelming, fierce, all-compelling urging to live the fulness
of experience.</p>

<p>The key unlocked the secret of the very mountains and the
waters. Out of the vasty space this mighty urging of life creating
itself into the vehicles of worlds, creating itself from worlds
into more emotional creatures upon the world, gathers into forms,
attracts, repels, coheres into shapes, reaches to the mystery of
crystals. Baffled by the rigidity of the rocks, dissipated in the
elusiveness of the waters, the mystic life gropes its way towards
subtler channels of embodiment. On through the flowers of the
field this urging to fuller life gropes towards emotion&mdash;and, freed
from its root&#8217;s anchorage to the rigid soil, behold, out of the
yeasty ooze it realizes itself through fish and reptile and bird into
beast. On, through the brute, increasing by rebirth, at first
blindly seeking to fulness in the humblest sensations, working
up from stage to stage, struggling and striving always to feel the
fullest emotions, developing for itself bodily organs which shall
nourish it and do it service, that it may most fully achieve itself&mdash;it
essays to fullest experience through brute force and reaches
by struggle of the physically fittest to the body of the lion and the
tiger and monster&mdash;retires baffled from mere bodily force, and,
essaying through the cunning of the brain its fuller fulfilment,
forms for its embodiment the nimble ape. For its protection and
aggrandisement the brain&#8217;s cunning gives craft to the hands and
sets them to the making of tools, and lo! at a stroke the rushlight
of early reason thrusts the savage above the brute. It steps down
from the trees, and Man, finding his hands&#8217; use, and straddling on
two legs, stands upright and a-wonder. The miracle has happened.
Life has become conscious of itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And, God! what a seething hell of misery it looks upon!</p>

<p>The youth shut the second book of the wisdom of Schopenhauer,
his brows set, and gazed with sad eyes at the Tragedy of Existence.
He was overwhelmed with the sorrow of the world.</p>

<p>This untameable never-satisfied urging to fulness of life that
stirs at the heart of all things, what had it wrought? Seen
glumly through the spectacles of Pessimism the light went out of
the heavens. The youth flinched from the welter of the universe.</p>

<p>What a welter it was! what a shambles!</p>

<p>The hawk preying on the exquisite design that is the body of
the small feathered songster&mdash;the tiger slaying for daily food the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
timid deer that is innocent of malignity to him&mdash;the wolf flying at
the throat of the lamb&mdash;the rabbit taking fearfully to the earth to
be cruelly slain in his hiding-place by the ferret. Everywhere life
taking life. No refuge from the brutal struggle. Man battening
on his fellow-man. The cruel and the unscrupulous, in war, in
commerce, in Church and State, treading under foot their gentler
companions&mdash;self-interest the one god. Man going to church of
a Sunday to listen with bowed head to a plan of life which it is his
sole aim to evade for the rest of the week&mdash;and, as crown to his
hypocrisies, marching to battle with songs of the Prince of Peace
to slay his fellows.</p>

<p>Tssh! the brutality of it! the cursed cruelty of it! the
bestiality of it!</p>

<p>Success in life! what was it but the record of other hearts
broken, other spirits crushed, other homes rendered desolate?</p>

<p>Everywhere was aggression, pursuit, sorrow, suffering. The
rich trampling down the poor. The beautiful body built only to
decay. The love of life given, to be baffled by death. At the
end of all our hopes and strivings and ambitions yawns the grave.</p>

<p>Everywhere sorrow and pain.</p>

<p>We remember pain. The agonies cling in the recollection&mdash;the
joys are forgot. Health is not realized until it is gone&mdash;nor youth&mdash;nor
liberty. Yet these are amongst the greatest good. Even
enjoyment is damped by habit. Opposition and disappointment
were sure&mdash;and always&mdash;and everywhere.</p>

<p>This very intellect, that raised man above the brute, and gave
the fuller powers in the struggle for life&mdash;what happiness did it
bring? It dangled hopes and ambitions and joys before the eyes,
simply to deceive the passionate urging of life to fiercer struggle
for life.</p>

<p>The intellect! man&#8217;s boast over the brute&mdash;it was the crown of
thorns.</p>

<p>Intellect! which was given as the last plague&mdash;the brutes had
been spared <i>that</i>. Thought warring with impulse; the love of
beauty and of justice fighting the appetites and the body&#8217;s yearnings
which impel our actions to the brutal struggle for life; contemplation
upon the ignobleness of these appetites and base injustices
and greeds impotent before the overwhelming lusts and
impulses and emotions of the body.</p>

<p>Imagination!&mdash;to shrink from the seething dunghill of the
world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Was there any deliverance from this miserable tyranny of life?
Only by boldly standing across the path of life and refusing to
share in it.</p>

<p>He opened the third book of the wisdom of Schopenhauer, and
he found the two means that Pessimism has found, by denial, to
accept life in full&mdash;art for art&#8217;s sake, and the asceticism of religion.</p>

<p>By steeping self in the contemplation of the beauty of works of
art, outside and aloof from self, in the contemplative pleasure of
craftsmanship and artistry we may escape for awhile from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
brutal urgings of our life, forget for awhile the brutal struggle for
existence round about and at every hand, ignore the cruelty of
the world. In the subtle pleasure that comes from a work of art
can we alone be purely contemplative&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;this Schopenhauer fellow had wisdom.</p>

<p>The Youth put his hand upon the book, and by the gods he
swore it, he would follow art for art&#8217;s sake. He would seek
salvation from the tyranny of living in the contemplation of the
beautiful.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which sees the Day break in the Tavern of</i> The Golden Sun</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A misty</span> dark night. The drizzle that slowly drenched the town
met with but damp welcome the students and revellers as they
poured out of the Bal Bullier at midnight; it sent them swarming
into the genial warmth and cheery glitter of the caf√©s on the
Boule Miche.</p>

<p>And the inhospitable rain, having emptied the streets, slyly
took itself off into the outer darkness and passed out of the city,
leaving the trees weeping in the blackness.</p>

<p>Noll, wearied by the frantic toolings of the students&#8217; Bal
Bullier, put up the collar of his coat, and finding that the drizzle no
more wet his face, he strolled down the Boule Miche, struck across
the cobbles of the riverside quays, and striding into the murk that
hung about the river, he found himself on the bridge. He stood
and leaned over the parapet, peering into the blackness of the
foggy depths that swirled in pitchy fumes below.</p>

<p>The yeasty stillness yielded a sob.</p>

<p>A young woman&#8217;s voice near at hand spoke low.</p>

<p>Aubrey&#8217;s voice answered her, impatiently. The fog carried
every inflection of his drawling irritation and peevish insolence.
He pshawed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Women take love so seriously,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;it is women who
spoil it.... Love is the pastime of life, the gaiety of days, a
thing to enrich the senses, to give man his recreation&mdash;and women
filch it of the very essence of its charm by making it the sordid
business of life. Robbed of its delicate mysteries, of its butterfly
flitting from flower to flower, it becomes&mdash;marriage&mdash;and the
begetting of children&mdash;and the clamour of household needs&mdash;and
milk-bottles&mdash;and soiled linen.... Why are you not content
to love many men, H√©l√®ne, as I have found the rhapsody of life in
loving many women?... It is the spiritual&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The spiritual!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed a little harsh laugh; and added sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, master Aubrey&mdash;we know each other too well to make
it worth while to lie&mdash;it deceives neither ourselves nor the other;
wherefore then the intention of it?... I would only ask you
not to love the other woman <i>before</i> me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>She was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said hoarsely, &#8220;this air is killing me&mdash;I must have
warmth&mdash;I am starving, body and soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i> does not close till daybreak,&#8221;
he said sullenly.</p>

<p>She laughed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;they turn life upside down&mdash;the artists&mdash;like
the religious....&#8221; She sighed consent. &#8220;All right. We
will go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed Noll, where he leaned against the parapet of the
bridge, almost touching him.</p>

<p>He roused moodily and followed the sound of their footsteps in
the pitchy murk.</p>

<p>He, too, would go to the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>.</p>

<p>He turned to his left as he stepped off the bridge, and kept by
the river-wall.</p>

<p>There came to him now and then through the clammy darkness
ahead the sound of the girl&#8217;s coughing. This woman was H√©l√®ne,
the fragile beauty whom Aubrey had filched from her easy-going
husband, a young doctor of the commercial quarter across the
river. In the letter she had written to bid the honest commonplace
fellow farewell (Aubrey had told it at a tavern merry-making
amidst the sly laughter of his fellows) she had complained that he
had no romance, that the very soles of his thick and clumsy boots
were like his own solid soul, an offence to her sense of the
subtleties&mdash;that she must out into the world to seek romance and
the colour of life. The blow had fallen out of a serene day in the
face of the poor fellow, and it was matter of common report that
he had reeled from it&mdash;he, being unpoetical and unappreciative of
the picturesque glamour of wickedness, had not even appreciated
that he was party to a romance&mdash;had taken instead to avoiding
his fellows and was walking with Shame&mdash;furtively, unheroically.
Paris had laughed. And the girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was getting her fill of crude adventure now....</p>

<p>Out of the reek there came again to Noll the pitiful cough. The
footsteps stopped for awhile. A quickly suppressed sob. Again
footsteps.</p>

<p>In the sombre gliding river below, the green lights of vaguely
looming blacknesses that were canal-boats, splashed emerald
flames in the inky flood. Loomed now across the waters the
massive solidity of the twin-towered cathedral, black against the
black night; and beyond and low down upon the pitchy tide the
pale lights that burn all night in the house of the dishonoured dead
gleamed through the window-slats of the Morgue.</p>

<p>Noll, hearing the cough again, roused to the sound that the
others had left the riverside. He crossed the drenched quays,
and leaving the river behind him, struck into a narrow street that
was possessed by the spectral wraithes flung down the grimy old
walls by the ghostly lamps that hung thereon. Along the gloomy
thoroughfare the chill airs, from the river hard by, set the lamp&#8217;s
flame flickering, and sent dusky shadows moving stealthily out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
dingy doorways and black corners, shadows that stealthily stole
back again. And amidst the silent spectres, flecked by the down-flung
light of the creaking wall-lamps, flitted the figures of the
man and woman; and back from amongst the ghostly wraithes
came the pitiful harsh cough.</p>

<p>Their shadowy figures turned into the squalid street that is
called the Rue Galande; and Noll closely followed them, they
came to a halt before the low arch of a doorway and stepped out
of sight.</p>

<p>When Noll reached the arch, the red maw of which yawned into
the sordid street, he saw by the legend written upon the glass of
the battered gas-lamp which hung awry overhead that he was at
the threshold of the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>. Across the dark
stretch of rudely paved courtyard beyond, the two figures were
passing blackly under the yellow flood of a gas-lamp, the restless
flame of which showed a flight of steps leading underground. The
twain descended into the gloom of the passage and were swallowed
in the cellars from which came a gust of song and the sound of
music as the doors opened and shut upon them.</p>

<p>Noll descended the steps, pushed open the doors at the bottom,
and stepped into the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>.</p>

<p>He blinked at the lighted room, dim as it was. The heavy air,
laden with the fumes of beer, and hazy with the clouds of tobacco-smoke,
met him with a pleasant warmth of welcome.</p>

<p>Through the haze he saw that the people sat, silently giving
their whole attention to a slender youth who stood at the far end
of the room declaiming verse, leaning upon a piano&mdash;a grey-haired
musician touching mellow chords gently and running a light accompaniment
of music atune with the speaker&#8217;s fine voice.</p>

<p>Noll was little in need of the superfluous pantomime of a burly
thick-set waiter who made melodramatic signs to him to stand
still&mdash;to make no sound.</p>

<p>As he stood there, listening to the telling accents of the young
poet, his eyes ranged over the strange gathering of bohemians
who sat about the little round tables. They were shabby enough,
some of them, to have been the denizens of a thieves&#8217; kitchen; but
there was an atmosphere of culture abroad that took all incongruity
from the noble sentiments and subtlety of accent that fell
from the lips of the poet in that dingy place.</p>

<p>The women who sat at the tables were not the gay butterflies
that flitted in silk and satin about the glittering caf√©s of the Boule
Miche. Their picturesqueness was of a more subtle kind, and
its daintiness shone through the pitiful simplicity of meagre
apparel.</p>

<p>Here were no rollicking students; here was no frantic fooling;
here was a note in the air that Noll had not yet heard sounding
in gatherings that laid more strenuous claims to the pursuit of
art.</p>

<p>His eyes ranging, caught signs from Aubrey to go and sit beside
him; and, the poem ending in a dulcet pathetic sigh for the eternal
tragedy of life, Noll took advantage of the resulting bravos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
applause to make his way to Aubrey&#8217;s table. The quick-eyed
waiter was there as soon as he, and bawled Noll&#8217;s order for three
bocks of beer to the patroness, who shrilly echoed it.</p>

<p>Aubrey was frankly glad to see him; and it was soon abundantly
clear to Noll that he was as frankly glad to be relieved from the
sole entertainment of the pallid woman beside him. H√©l√®ne, too,
roused to interest in the fine young Englishman&mdash;the frown left
her handsome brows.</p>

<p>The grey-haired musician ran his slender fingers over the keys
of the piano; and there stepped on to the little platform on which
it stood the only man who seemed out of place in that strange
company of dreamers. Burly, powerful, big-headed, with
cunning eyes that count profits, slits above baggy underlids,
he was of the blonde breed that plans and orders&mdash;full-bellied,
calculating, of those whose fat hands get money, and, with short
grasping pointed fingers, hold it when got. He rang a little bell,
and silence followed its tinklings.</p>

<p>H√©l√®ne leaned over to Noll:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is <i>The Golden Sun</i>,&#8221; she whispered, and laughed low.</p>

<p>He had the honour to announce that Madame H√©l√®ne would
declaim an apostrophe from her last written work.</p>

<p>The young woman arose simply, smiled to Noll, and making her
way to the piano, took her place before it amidst a salvo of applause;
and with a strange thrill in her husky voice, she spoke of
the cruelty of Nature, the eyes glowing in the deep shadows of her
fine brows that gleamed white amidst the masses of her tawny
hair, where she stood below the light, gracefully poised against the
piano. She uttered the exquisitely phrased sentences in a well
modulated low voice that was vibrant with suppressed passion,
without trick, without gesture.... The warfare of life was unceasing,
unmerciful. Race struck at race, man lay in wait for man&mdash;on
the mart, on the field of battle, in love, robbed the one the
other of the simplest needs of life.... Everywhere was struggle&mdash;everywhere
was strenuous rivalry&mdash;at the end of all, the grave....
The caged bird, what a thing of pity! Denied the range
of life, destitute of its mate, its wings cramped, its functions
atrophied&mdash;yet&mdash;open the door of its narrow prison, let it but fly
across the sweet-scented meadows, and a hawk swings out of the
heavens, falls from the splendid blue, and strikes with rending
claws, and tears out with cruel well-contrived beak the little
life from the delicately designed beauty of the songster....
Why flutter against the encaging bars? why struggle ever to be
in the winds and the free airs? Tush! wherein was freedom but
to flee from death? The little fragile thing had the gift of song;
let it be glad that it had the gift of song.</p>

<p>She uttered the pity of it in the most caressing tongue that the
nations have wrought; and when she had spoken the last word,
she bowed to the thunder of applause, came back to the table, and
seated herself by Noll with a freedom from conceit that touched
him.</p>

<p>They came and clasped her hand, and gave her ungrudging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
praise, with all the airs and kindly dignity of France. And Noll
noticed that Aubrey was gone....</p>

<p>The room was gay with banter and laughter, glasses clinked,
the waiter sped about busily, bawling orders, and the smoke of
cigarettes clouded the ceiling.</p>

<p>And, of a truth, the atmosphere of the place had a strange
fascination for Noll.</p>

<p>Here were no longer the crude essayings, and the more crude
aims of fledgling studenthood. He was weary of the fierce partisanship,
the shifting foundations, the tentative idols of their passing
frenzies, this taking of sides about things that did not matter.</p>

<p>These people were out of the years of their apprenticeship to
the arts.</p>

<p>Here, on the other hand, was no posing at all costs for outrageous
originality, no seeking for the eccentric aspect of things,
none of the fantastic extravagances that marked the revels of the
sordid gatherings in the taverns of Montmartre&mdash;for these people
had no desire to the breaking of idols, the outraging of the decencies,
the mocking at ideals.</p>

<p>Art, to these people, was the one serious aim of life.</p>

<p>There was scarce a line uttered this night, whether of recited
poem or song or criticism, which was not perfect in the expression,
exquisite and subtle in the phrasing. There was that air of tactful
restraint and of rightness of statement which in manners are called
good breeding. And if the emotions uttered were somewhat thin
or exaggeratedly sad or tinged overmuch and disproportionately
with the grey half-tones of the pathos of life, if vigour and the
strenuous music of the bright days and the gaiety of life were
almost wholly absent, there was at any rate a feeling for beauty
and a sobbing appeal to the pity of the world for such as are overwhelmed
by the destiny of tragedy that held something of nobility.</p>

<p>These men and women were content, if a neglectful world so
ordered it, to live here in obscurity and poverty, their sole incentive
to life the worship of beauty. Upon the workaday world
they turned careless shoulders&mdash;and for them the workaday
world, in grim retort, had no uses, no honours. The worst sin to
them was to be Philistine. Here they met together at a time when
drowsy citizens were getting into their unthinking beds&mdash;here
they were happy in the companionship of their fellows throughout
the long night, exchanging their ideas of the beautiful, their
polished gentle wit, their praises&mdash;here, shrugging contemptuous
shoulders at the conventions of the world, men and women lived
and loved as they listed.</p>

<p>If the world should one day awaken to the works of their
genius, so much the better for the world&mdash;if it should clamour for
their poesy, their song, their works of art, well and good. They
would be glad that the world had taste enough to give them fame.
But the world must come to them.... It would make life
easier&mdash;their clothes would be less shabby&mdash;hunger less biting,
less insistent. But what had the world to give them better than the
love of beauty or more pleasant than the comradeship of them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
knew beauty when they saw it? The generations perhaps would
greedily seek the work of their brains; fame would come if it came.</p>

<p>So said they, gentle-mannered, shabbily attired, simple-hearted,
warming their starved blood with brandy and bocks of beer and
accursed brain-stealing absinthe, living on each other&#8217;s kindliness
and praise and genial comradeship, living in dreams, walking on
air, wayfarers in cloudland, scorning all meannesses, garnering
with difficulty the poorest sustenance for daily bread, cheerful
though the frost bit and the hunger thinned their already lean ribs,
and penurious want made their blankets few&mdash;proud in their
dignity, pitiful to every suffering thing.</p>

<p>Why heed the sensational events of the day? what mattered
that a Minister had fallen? what did it matter that a scandal was
washing dirty linen in the streets? Such things were dead and
buried and forgot in nine days&mdash;but art and music and poetry remained,
beauty was eternal. Why compete in the sordid money-grubbing
race for wealth? We must all die. Why this strenuous
hurrying to the open grave?</p>

<p>So they reasoned. And they brought to their meeting no sign
or word of their hard struggle for daily bread. They brought to
their comradeship only laughter and wit and gentle faces and
smiles....</p>

<p>The small hours of the night passed.</p>

<p>It was nearing five o&#8217;clock, and the room began to thin of its
frequenters. Noll called the waiter and paid the reckoning of
saucers for himself and H√©l√®ne. She arose with him to go; and
as they opened the doors and stepped out of the heavy air of the
room, the grey dawn had broken and the dingy lamp of <i>The
Golden Sun</i> was paling into insignificance in the chill day.</p>

<p>As they reached the river, they found, swathed in multitudinous
wraps, a stout woman who was selling hot milk and rolls. Noll
did not ask the girl, but ordered a couple of bowls of the comforting
stuff and a roll. The girl drank the milk gladly; and
of the roll she was very careful not to lose the crumbs.</p>

<p>Noll took her to her poor room on the fifth story where was her
threadbare home.</p>

<p>At the threshold she asked him in.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>He took her pathetic face between his two hands, and kissed her
upon the wan cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, H√©l√®ne,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I love another woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and went into her room.</p>

<p>As he descended the stair she came out to him again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be at <i>The Golden Sun</i> to-night?&#8221; she asked&mdash;her
lips a little anxious and apart&mdash;beautiful lips.</p>

<p>He hesitated&mdash;pondered&mdash;smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Noll crossed the Boule Miche a white mist hung over the
river; at the far end of the students&#8217; highway the heavens were
chilly grey; all the stars were burnt out of the drab firmament.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero goes out into the Night</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll</span> slept till late into the afternoon, awoke heavy, and loafed
aimlessly about his room, hoping to do some work before the dusk
fell; but ideas were shy of him, and, as the afternoon wore on,
he grew ever more restless. Flinging into an armchair, he opened
the book of the wisdom of Schopenhauer which tells of the Refuge
from the brutalities of Life in Works of Art&mdash;in the contemplation
of the Beautiful. And he steeped himself in the pessimistic
writings until the light failed. At the coming of the darkness he
roused, made himself some coffee, lit the lamp, and getting back
to his easy-chair he pored over the gospel of Art for Art&#8217;s sake
until midnight.</p>

<p>At midnight he stretched, yawned, and, putting on his cloak and
hat, turned out the light, and drifted to the streets again and so to
the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>.</p>

<p>H√©l√®ne was there, at a table, watching the door for his coming.
A pretty flush warmed her pale cheeks as she saw him enter and
scan the place for sign of her. She beckoned him to the empty
chair beside her&mdash;and he went.</p>

<p>The handsome young Englishman, virile, frank, gentle in his
strength, fascinated her. His attitude towards her interested her,
a little piqued her, flattered her, baffled her. All the shafts of her
country&#8217;s wit against the amourousless habits of his people tickled
her to the smiling point; yet she suspected that behind the self-confident
eyes strong passions lurked.... She herself thrilled
at his touch, would have flung herself upon him, clung to him&mdash;would
gladly have yielded body or soul to him&mdash;yet she saw that
he was in no mood for her surrender. She was burnt, fevered, with
the eagerness of reckless passion. Yet his frank liking for her, his
friendliness, his charming desire to hear always her criticism of life
and of art and of things, his pretty homage and deference to her
intellectual point of view, won her to him in a pleasant comradeship
that gave new life to her. She had heard of these friendships
with men&mdash;but Paris had never before offered her such sweets.
She would watch him with curious eyes that were lit with a smile
when he turned to look upon her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>So it came that Noll drifted away from the boisterous community
of the students and their nightly riot, and took to haunting
the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>&mdash;drifted from his blithe companions
in all their irresponsible rollicking gaiety of youth and fell into
the drab habits of these shiftless folk who put artistry and the
beautiful before life.</p>

<p>By day he slept; and when he did not sleep he pored over this
Schopenhauer&#8217;s scheme of evading all thought of the misery of
living in the contemplation of the Beautiful&mdash;at night he lived it.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>The first freshness wore off.</p>

<p>Youth became restless.</p>

<p>The contemplation of the beautiful, in works of art, was no deliverance
from the striving of the desire to live. Even in enjoying
the beauty of craftsmanship the struggle for life and the cruel
facts of life could only be put out of one&#8217;s thoughts but for a very
little while; nay, art even pointed to life; nay, more, this very
art is in its essence the emotional statement of nature and of life!...
Fool! Life that was beautiful to contemplate in its parts
could not be wholly ugly in the living.</p>

<p>Youth rubbed awakening eyes.</p>

<p>Art as a refuge from life was a failure.</p>

<p>He looked round at these faded wits about him.</p>

<p>This devotion to beauty of craftsmanship, to mere letters, to
paint, to music, to technical achievement&mdash;it could only bring
passing consolation of delight. It did not, it could not bring
perfect rest&mdash;absolute contentment. Sordid hours had still to be
lived&mdash;and, God! what sordid hours!</p>

<p>Even whilst they spoke the half-truth that Craft must and
should always be beautiful, must aim at perfection of statement,
be pleasant, give delight&mdash;poor souls&mdash;their wan eyes could not
wholly put from them that Craft is but the tool of Art; and Art
is the expression of all the emotions and sensations&mdash;ranges the
whole gamut of life, good and bad, ugly and beautiful, tragedy and
comedy. Art therefore inspires or it debases; and thus and so
stimulates life to fulfil itself&mdash;or not to fulfil. Art is good or it is
bad&mdash;is as powerful for bad as for good&mdash;good when it enlarges
life; bad when it narrows life. The emotions discover for us far
more vasty continents than the eyes of voyagers shall ever behold.</p>

<p>Youth awoke.</p>

<p>These people about him were Failures&mdash;the pallid ghosts of men
and women.</p>

<p>They were taken up with the shadow.</p>

<p>Could this delight in the mere craftsmanship of art be enough?
Was this sufficient end? Was it for this the world had been
evolved, to this that was set the vast music of the spheres? To
this end&mdash;to be set down beautifully in man&#8217;s handwriting&mdash;that
the thunders brought the lightnings to the riven oak, that the
wondrous mystic seasons took their courses, that the waters leaped
hissing to the tornado&#8217;s smite, that the angry majesty of the resounding
heavens gave place to exultant sunshine and serenest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
peace! Were these things so, but to be set down in man&#8217;s scrap-albums?</p>

<p>Was delight in craftsmanship enough to live for?</p>

<p>Tush! this was absolute, if subtle, suicide&mdash;self-killing of the
body and intellect and conscience and will and energy. This
sipping at the mere pleasantnesses of life&mdash;it was emaciating them
in mind, body, will, senses.</p>

<p>Their very loves were a dandified make-believe. The kiss of a
woman&#8217;s mouth was become but a passing pleasure. All these
shabby little adulteries were without desire for the child beyond&mdash;the
child when it came was an unlooked-for inconsequence, a
burden, a thing of shame. The sweetest thing in life an affair of
accident&mdash;to be feared&mdash;flinched from!</p>

<p>Life might be a tragedy. These were making of it a melancholy
and a ghastly farce.</p>

<p>Noll got up from his place and slipped from the smoke-befogged
room amidst the clamorous din of applause that greeted the
recital of an Ode in Envy of One who had died Young.</p>

<p>He went out into the night.</p>

<p>And as he stepped out into the darkness the bitter cold gripped
him by the throat and cut into his lungs. He drew his collar about
his neck, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and tramped down
dingy streets that echoed his footfall along their haunted ways&mdash;he
thought with a pang of the threadbare coats of these pallid
revellers in the beautiful. It was the black hour that goes before
the coming of the daybreak; and blacker than the blackness of
the night loomed the great bulk of the cathedral of Notre Dame,
its towers lost in the reek of the bleak heavens above&mdash;there were
lights that showed low down and beyond&mdash;the lights of the Morgue
were not yet burnt out.</p>

<p>The youth stood on the bridge and peered at the sighing sound
that told of the river below; but his brows were knit upon the
destiny of these kindly gentle people he had left behind him.</p>

<p>Where was this sorry tragedy of art for art&#8217;s sake hurrying these
sinking wits?</p>

<p>Those dark shadows that slept under the bridges, were they the
husks of such human things? Was that the end? To share the
dank shelter with the rats that made their litter there! Or perhaps
in the black waters icy oblivion would solve their sorry
problem of evading the tragedy of living! The Morgue.</p>

<p>Nay, how they clung to this despised life, for all its sordidness,
for all its misery&mdash;even the Failures!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXVI</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero sets Foot upon the Road to Rome</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Midnight</span> did not see Noll at the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>.</p>

<p>He had failed to find deliverance from the tyranny of living in
the contemplation of the Beautiful&mdash;in Art for Art&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>Still obsessed with the misery and cruelty of the world, he sat
beside his lamp and opened the fourth book of the wisdom of
Schopenhauer, whose fearless brain had compelled upon him the
tragedy of existence; had promised to show him the way out&mdash;two
ways. One had failed.</p>

<p>He now turned eagerly to the other and the steeper road. He
climbed the rugged path of Asceticism.</p>

<p>The will urged always to Life, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Life was a sordid tragedy.</p>

<p>Why consent to take part in it?</p>

<p>Why indeed? asked scowling Schopenhauer. No man who
has seen through the torment of existence, who has grasped the
fact of the eternal unsatisfied Want, who has realized the brutalities
and the cruelties that are the very conditions of Life, can desire
anything but Quiescence&mdash;and complete quiescence only comes
with Death. The Buddhist and the primitive Christian had done
right&mdash;both of them. The Buddhist had looked to Nirvana, a
state of Nothingness, of eternal calm&mdash;the primitive Christian,
with the lure of a vague future bliss before his eyes, finding life on
earth a designed brutality, had looked on the life of this world as
a pitiful thing, and fixed his hopes on the gateway of Death to
bring him into the garden of eternal peace. The pessimism of the
East had had the seeing eye.</p>

<p>Death is the eternal sleep. And it may be met half way, in
bouts of contemplation upon Art. But&mdash;better&mdash;it may be met
almost the whole way. Until the will wholly cease in death, its
eager impulses, its insistent urgings to self-preservation, self-aggrandisement,
may be baulked and rendered futile by deliberately
opposing them. In asceticism the eager desires of life
could be almost wholly baulked. Through asceticism alone could
one refuse to be an accomplice in this designed crime of living&mdash;this
preying of life upon life. No wonder the medieval churches
had gripped the imagination of man! The child need not be born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to continue the brutal struggle for life. The ascetic monk and
virginal nun sternly refuse to hand on this miserable heritage to
further generations. Across the design of life stood the monk
and nun; their stern order&mdash;thou shalt not.</p>

<p>Through a great and profound pity for the suffering and the
weak and the losers in the brutal struggle for life, one could oppose
one&#8217;s self to the cruel order of things. In this sympathy and pity
alone could we raise a foundation of ethics that could demand
justice against the design&mdash;which opposed itself to the triumphant
brutality of the life&#8217;s struggle. In this great human pity for the
down-trodden could one not only find alleviation for the misery of
the world, but in it also could we find some balm for the criminal
fact of our very existence.</p>

<p>The road came out upon the pilgrim&#8217;s way. The pessimistic
conception of life led to the very gates of Rome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For days Noll haunted the great aisles of the cathedral of Notre
Dame&mdash;sat within the beautiful interiors of the old medieval
churches of Paris&mdash;dreamed&mdash;brooded over the problem of the
Refuge from Life&mdash;was thrilled with the thought that the lowly
and the meek should inherit the earth....</p>

<p>Amidst the fragrant scent of the swinging incense, to the
pathetic sob of the haunting chant, in the emotional atmosphere
of prayer, the great pity for all created things welled in his heart
and roused in him a passionate desire to be at grips with the
cruelty of life.</p>

<p>The mystic rites, the emblems, the symbolism of every act of
this splendid church&mdash;these things held the youth fascinated,
drew him, called to him.</p>

<p>That a vague, all-seeing, all-creating, all-powerful God, sitting
apart somewhere in the blue, had created the worlds out of His
omnipotence, had designed this scheme of life that the religious
condemned, had designed it from the beginning, and was carrying
out phase by phase every detail of it, and was angry with much of
the result of His own handiwork&mdash;all this was thoroughly atune
with the pessimistic conception of things. All these brutalities,
were they of God&#8217;s deliberate design? Well, there they were.
If there had been design, then they were a part.</p>

<p>And this being so, the churches had done right to set aside the
wrath of this Being, and, instead, to appeal to a redeemer&mdash;one
who had put himself against the brutalities of this design&mdash;who
had flung down his life to mitigate the brutalities. It was clear
that the salvation from such life was thus to oppose that life&mdash;was
to be found only in asceticism.</p>

<p>The big-browed scowling German had led the brooding youth
into the great mysterious precincts of the medieval church, and
left him there&mdash;it was his last word. And the youth, his ears
ecstatically alert to catch the whispers in the reverberant gloom
of its sonorous architecture, was overwhelmed with the majesty
of the great denial that is the heart of this ancient church.</p>

<p>And everything in his temperament urged thereto.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>Art moved him thitherwards&mdash;what he conceived to be art.</p>

<p>The Papist faith is that subtlest, most fascinating form of art
for art&#8217;s sake&mdash;religion for religion&#8217;s sake. From the years it has
taken boldly all symbolism that rouses the emotions of its own
significance&mdash;from its pagan altars to the saying of prayers by
rote. Whatever of outward pomp and majesty all other worship
has known, whatever of mysticism and of craftsmanship and of
artistry all other worship has known, this splendid church has
taken into itself. It had seized the great pessimistic solace that
is a passing refuge from life in the contemplation of works of art.
And now, here, too, was a church built to its foundations on the
rock of asceticism&mdash;on the bold denial of the majesty of life&mdash;on
the pessimistic, final, and only refuge from the desire for that fulness
of experience, from that life that its God had thrust upon it.</p>

<p>And it was so well-bred&mdash;everything in its place&mdash;everything
foreseen. It had an air. The music was sonorous, significant,
eloquent, mystic. The arts had given of their best. The pathos
of the voices that chanted the sad litanies that condemned life
filled him with a sense of the sorrow of the world. He lingered in
this atmosphere until he was worn out&mdash;he came home late at
night, weary and famished with his ecstatic fastings, and, having
eaten the meanest food, he would seat himself by the lamp and
pore over the mystic volumes. He steeped himself in the books
of Saint Teresa and others to which he had heard reference made.</p>

<p>Slowly the monastic spell cast its glamour over his intellect.
Once he had accepted the world as a place of suffering and a
punishment, the ascetics filled his imagination&mdash;the nuns and
priests &#8220;athirst for sorrow, drunk with self-sacrifice,&#8221; who bury
themselves in cloisters or go into life-banishment beyond the
outermost pales of civilization. His great pity for the suffering of
the world drew his bowed regard to the cloistered orders, the Carmelites
and the poor Clares who are chosen by the Christ as victims
of expiation, who unite together and gladly accept for their agony
the expiation of the temptations of the world outside&mdash;who go to
the deepest suffering, the prevention of sin by &#8220;substitution,&#8221;
taking the place of them that are too weak to withstand the
passions, and taking that place only by going through the full
urgings of such passions. Saint Teresa who took the temptations
of the soul of a priest who had not the strength to endure them;
Sister Catherine Emmerich who took the bodily pains of the sick;
Ludwine who &#8220;lusted for bodily suffering and was greedy for
wounds,&#8221; the &#8220;reaper of punishments,&#8221; he brooded with envy
upon the self-inflicted tortures of the Benedictine nuns of the
Blessed Sacrament, their austere day, their rising at two in the
night to chant, summer and winter, their turns before the tapers
of reparation and the altar. He thought of all these orders vowed to
obedience, absolute and without reserve&mdash;the complete surrender
to the superior, of their life, their movements, their actions, their
will, their judgment, their bodies, their instincts, their emotions.
And when he dwelt upon the contemplative orders, buried alive
in their monasteries and convents, he was overwhelmed. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
people had mastered the whole gamut of the conquest over the
desires of life....</p>

<p>The monastic orders passed before him in sombre pageant.
The black robe of Saint Benedict&mdash;had not his order kept learning
alive? until learning was become dangerous. These men, clad
in sombre sable, had been amongst the gentlemen of the world&mdash;and
its scholars. The contemplative Carthusian, the ascetic
Cistercian, the gentle Franciscan. The Jesuit, byword of subtlety
and finesse and trickery&mdash;it is true he had walked in crooked ways
to his goal, but he had had this wondrous church for goal....
The Dominican&mdash;no, he shrank back from the accursed white
robe of him that had stood before the inquisitorial fires and the
like tortures of his hellish devising, holding the sullied crucifix of
the great-souled Christ to the agonized eyes of the writhing victims
of his foul lust for cruelties. To save from the brutalities of life
by inflicting harsher brutalities&mdash;this had been to plumb the
criminal deeps of filthiness....</p>

<p>Yes, he had his hesitations, the youth.</p>

<p>His mind misgave him a little at the conceits and fooleries and
the indifferent yawnings of the choristers, at the absent-minded
recital of prayers uttered by the often weary priesthood, at the
beadles&#8217; sharp eye on the fees. It misgave him still more when he
thought upon the death in life which the nuns of the contemplative
orders set themselves&mdash;when he learnt that the age of twenty-nine
was a terrible period for the young woman to pass, that their
worst punishment was endured in those hours of agony in the
passionate regret for maternity when the barren womb revolts&mdash;when
he learnt that some nuns, killed by the torpor of the
cloisters, languish and die suddenly like the flames of candles
blown out by the wind. Nay, he clutched his throat in sudden
loathing and disgust and anger as he read Saint Teresa&#8217;s order in
her <i>Way of Perfection</i>, that the nun who shall be guilty of insubordination
should at once and for life be imprisoned in her cell.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Contemplation, prayer, pity, self-repression, asceticism! The
strenuous urging of life did not find a loophole there through which
to enter in, with disturbing energetic breath and organic instincts
and the jumping blood of adventure. And if these things secured
the refuge from the cruel struggle of living, why not accept the
whole of the rest, the formalities, the etiquette, the infallibility
of its pontiffs, the real presence in the wafer in the priest&#8217;s mouth,
the confession to the priesthood, the surrender of the body and of
the intellect and of the will and the conscience to the Church that
&#8220;orders the body to be silent and the soul to suffer,&#8221; and holds
that &#8220;true life begins not at birth but at death&#8221;?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Foul Things are Plotted with some Glamour of Romance</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in this mental ferment that, one day, idly seating himself
at the table where Betty had wrought, and brooding there, Noll
put out his hand to one of the small brass knobs of the writing-table,
and opened a little drawer. It was fragrant with the atmosphere
of freshness and life and sweetness which was a part of
her winsome being. It brought the witchery of her brown hair to
him, her dainty ways, the beautiful firm gentle hands, the white
skin that flushed so easily, the eager loyal lips, the courageous will,
the happy eyes, the cheerfulness and gaiety of her glad young
womanhood.</p>

<p>In the opened drawer lay what looked like the final proofs of the
chapter of a book&mdash;or had she torn the pages from some magazine?</p>

<p>He read the Fragment from The Masterfolk: which ran:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Rid thyself of the pessimistic error that confuses Life with Lust.
The duel between the lust of the emotions and the contemplation of
Reason is but in the seeming, as the right hand is against the left.
The emotions and the reason but hedge in the highway of thy wayfaring
to guide the instincts of life along the way to the highest fulfilment.
Joy urges life forward to the achieving; pain turns aside
from danger; and the reason is the eye of the emotions. Bereft of
reason, the emotions are blind; and the blind in soul are not of the
Masterfolk.</i></p>

<p><i>Good and evil are not at duel; these twain are not rigid and
separate realities taking sides in a quarrel of the universe; good is
the way by which life travels to the achieving of the highest experience;
evil is that way by which life falls away from the achieving.</i></p>

<p><i>There is no other good nor evil....</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Noll laid down the Fragment of The Masterfolk, the
evening was well spent.</p>

<p>He went to the window and gazed down through the damp
night upon the smoke and flare of Paris that steamed in the reek.
His mind turned to the busy world at his feet....</p>

<p>As he pulled on his coat, he noticed that there were two volumes
in the pockets. He laughed. They were the wisdom of Schopenhauer&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the refuge from life in art and of the refuge from life in
asceticism.</p>

<p>He left them there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;as if life were given to be evaded!&#8221;</p>

<p>He put on his cloak and hat, and walked down into the streets.</p>

<p>As he turned into the great boulevards, the people were swarming
out of the theatres, their eyes still smiling at the comedies.
There was the shuffle of feet, and hum of conversation, and
laughter that punctuated genial waggeries. Bright caf√©s were
crowded inside and out with the ranks and array of chattering
people.</p>

<p>He went under an awning and seated himself in a back row; the
waiter at his call brought him a foaming tankard of beer. And
he sat and sipped and brooded there alone in the midst of the
buzzing of the pleasure-hive.</p>

<p>Paris flashed and flamed in the night&mdash;that brightly lighted
Paris of many lamps that lies between the crazy heights of Montmartre
to the north and the students&#8217; quarter beyond the river to
the south&mdash;the great central world of Paris, that is the ordinary
workaday pleasure-seeking-at-the-end-o&#8217;-the-day&#8217;s-work world
that knows little and cares less for the fantastic aspirations and
the mockeries of the hill of martyrs, or the artistic aims of the left
bank. Here stepped the good citizen of the gayest when not
saddest people of the world, in the streets that are his public
drawing-room, smiling at life, strutting with wife or mistress his
evening stroll, before getting off to his virtuous or unvirtuous bed,
living his life by habit and rote, taking it as it comes, turning reflective
eyes upon it never. In the highways the great painted omnibuses
rumbled past, taking up swarms of home-going folk from
their sauntering evening pleasures of the town. The white-hatted
and black-hatted hackney coachmen cracked loud whips and urged
their nags to the winning of their last fares for the night. Here
strolled the sturdy everyday folk, respectable and commonplace
and prolific and jovial, who went to their churches of a Sunday or
did not go, as their forefathers before them, and for much the
same reason of confirmed habit, asked no questions, but came into
their religion or lack of it, and of their concept of life, by heredity;
even as their hair grew, and they waked and sleeped. Here were no
brows troubled with nerve-racking introspection. Anxieties were
on far other scores. The women, with skirts held up, frankly
showed ankles that were not aimlessly stockinged, and dressed
their shapely bodies frankly trusting the men liked it so; here the
men turned and as frankly admired them.... Here the world
passed and repassed, gaily and genially human. Most had never
heard of Shakespeare, few had read him; to nearly all, Homer
was as dead as higher mathematics; to most, Dante would have
been an intolerable bore; to many, Milton a giver of sleep. Nay,
Moli√®re was known to these as master of dull French, that had
wearied their school-day youth.... Here were soldiers that
slammed steel scabbards upon the flags, and police that yawned
because the world must be respectable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>A stout burgess, his plump wife upon his arm, came and took
seats at the little table beside Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean has the commercial flare,&#8221; said he, blowing mightily and
mopping a perspiring forehead with florid handkerchief. &#8220;He
has won marbles on a system.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was raising of admiring hands at the child&#8217;s promise.
Madame sighed&mdash;to think the boy springing up.... There was
a pause, and memories of the child&#8217;s arms about her neck&mdash;her
eyes filled with tears&mdash;and she spoke of the cares so happily borne&mdash;the
days that were gone came back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yvonne had fancied a piece of lace to go with her white gown
and veil for her confirmation.&#8221; The good dame laughed lightly.
&#8220;Ah, she herself had worn it&mdash;mon Dieu! how many years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pinched her ear.</p>

<p>She bore her old age well, he said; still, he himself was absolutely
ancient&mdash;nearly forty!</p>

<p>And they both laughed.</p>

<p>The good man smoked a cigarette; she flipped through an
illustrated paper; they sipped liqueurs; called the waiter at last;
paid the reckoning; exchanged a jest or so, and departed, he
lifting his hat to the house.</p>

<p>Others came and went.</p>

<p>Noll brooded on.</p>

<p>What had been all the frantic ecstasy of art for art&#8217;s sake to the
world at large? An absolute nothing. And what was this
ascetic hatred of life?</p>

<p>The aim of life is not to live in poet&#8217;s rhyme&mdash;nor does our
neighbour pass feverish nights fearful of losing immortality. The
poet may be shaken with such fears for his verse; the ambitious
may see in dreams their names writ in flashing jewels on the face
of time, glittering like stars beyond their daily lusting; but the
man of the street scratches his poll to no such questionings. He
has to live. He asks, and he has the right to ask, that he may live
his life in hope and happiness and all becoming jollity. There will
be rough stones enough beneath his feet, walk he ever so nicely.
Why be jealous of worldly fame? The names and fames of the
ancient masters of the world, king and conqueror, are vanished&mdash;their
very gods have taken wing. There are some chipped relics&mdash;the
rest is in the spindrift of time....</p>

<p>What was all this abstract pity of the world? what did it
affect? What was it but the conceit of sheer egoism?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the darkness beyond the flare of the caf√©, on the benches that
skirted the roadway, sat several shabby fellows&mdash;frayed, down-at-heels,
haggard. Their pale faces stared out of the darkness at the
festive loungers along the caf√©&#8217;s front. Out of the gloom their
hungry eyes sullenly followed the shifting figures that passed to
and fro across the golden flare of the brightly lighted place. The
younger ones scowled, brooding pensively&mdash;one now and then
muttering a rough jest to the others. But they were mostly
silent. The elder, dirtier, and more ragged, with hands deep-thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
into pockets of filthy trousers, shrugged stooped shoulders,
and watched the shifting comedy that passed unwittingly before
their eyes. A tattered fellow from amongst them would rise and
pick up a cigarette-end that fell upon the pavement from light
discarding fingers.</p>

<p>The ranks of chairs along the caf√©&#8217;s front began to empty.</p>

<p>Noll roused, called to the waiter, paid him, and strolled into the
night....</p>

<p>The waiters came out and cleared away the tables and chairs
and put up the shutters.</p>

<p>The lights went out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The faces that had stared out of the night sank on to drowsy
chests, and the wastrels of the boulevards fell asleep on their hard
benches.</p>

<p>One fellow amongst them arose, yawned, and drowsily shuffled
down the road to a bench that was not so crowded; he lay down
upon it, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He had scarcely fallen into a drowse when a dim slouching figure
came out of the black drizzle that was setting in, and, hesitating
near him, peered into his face&mdash;put out his hand and touched the
sleeping man upon the shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be a wet night. This is
wretched shelter for a master mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other roused, uttered an oath, laughed grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gavroche,&#8221; said the stooping man in a hoarse whisper&mdash;&#8220;the
mists are rising from the river.&#8221; He looked up and down the road
cautiously: &#8220;There&#8217;s a drunken carter has lost his way and is
wandering on the quays. Perhaps he would have fallen into the
river anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavroche roused and sat up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he has been paid his wage or would not be
drunk.... And he is near the river.... What a death, my
comrade, to go out of the world with a full skin!... Some
rogues have all the luck.... Come.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero scatters some Pages of the Indifferent Wisdom of
the Ages to the even more Indifferent Gulls</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the black night, Noll stood on the bridge at the end of the
Boule Miche. The cathedral loomed sombrely amid the darkness.</p>

<p>But the darkness was resonant with the promise of a mighty
music.</p>

<p>The youth had awakened.</p>

<p>A load was fallen from him.</p>

<p>The mists were rising from his soul. He stooped in his eagerness
and peered at the years.</p>

<p>He began to see the Reality of things. He was filled with a
strange excitement. He went back in fancy, and picked up the
thread of the unravelling of life where it had dropped from his
fingers in his eagerness to follow Schopenhauer&#8217;s inert nerveless
guidance.</p>

<p>The scowling genius of the German had nearly found the truth&mdash;that
a mighty desire for life was at the core of all existence.
And here had slipped the mighty intellect; and the crabbed hands,
groping in the half-darkness, missing the little, had missed the all,
since that which stirs at the heart of all things is not a will to live,
but life&mdash;life with an overwhelming urging to fulfil its fullest self.
Nay, urging so overwhelming that, to know the fullest life, it
lightly takes the risks of death in the achieving.</p>

<p>The bitter lips, not given to understatements, had yet understated
the whole case. He of the surly shoulders had gone before
the youth, beckoning him, until they were stepping along the hard
stony ways of unhandsome half-truths that wounded the feet,
and straying in the dirty alleys where the refuse is shot, their
attention fixed on the cruelties, seeing only the shabby side of life.
And, for solace, the worthy German could point but to two ways
out of the shabbiness of his destiny&mdash;art and asceticism.</p>

<p>But this was not life at all.</p>

<p>The youth awaked to find the highway of life to be clean and
healthy and glorious and beautiful. He stepped back upon it.
Up aloft and afar and hard by, the world sang with the joy of life;
and the motherhood of the world held out immaculate arms to
him. He stood at gaze with life, and he saw that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
misery; nay, so far from being compact of misery, life lay before
him unutterably sweet, thrillingly magnificent; so pleasant that
we do not notice the delight of sheer living until misery knocks
at our doors to say the order of our career is broken.</p>

<p>Life is to be lived, not baulked&mdash;otherwise we give the godhood
within us the lie.</p>

<p>There is no virtue in a doleful countenance, nor aught more
sacred in solemnity than in delight.</p>

<p>For Joy is serious as sorrow; comedy serious as Tragedy; life
serious as Death.</p>

<p>It came to the youth, standing there in the reek of the night,
that he was on the brink of manhood; he faced the prospect; and
the whisper of the Masterfolk came to him where he stood.</p>

<p>His intellect and his emotions were in a strange thrill&mdash;leaping
with a new and pulsing energy. Dawning manhood plucked at
his sleeve, pointing to life, staring inquisitive glances, rousing him
with restless innuendo&mdash;took him by the shoulder and said:
&#8220;Awake, thou hast done with drifting, thou must live, and guide
thy life, and choose thy ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to regard life as a drama in which he was now a
player, an important player. He was no longer of the audience&mdash;he
was compelled on to the stage. He suddenly became aware of
this. No matter how ill-dressed for the part, no matter how slip-shod,
no matter how stammering his tongue, how dull his art, how
ill-prepared to speak his lines, he must answer the call, must play
that part. He roused to the fear that he did not know his part&mdash;did
not know his cues, did not know even what was expected of
him. He must search out the book of the play. What a strange
tragi-comedy it was!</p>

<p>Tshah! pessimism&#8217;s refuges from life were but coward&#8217;s
shrinkings from the exultant thunders of the universe.</p>

<p>Life is life, whether it be lived in the full, with the full breath
of the heavens in the nostrils, and facing the dangers foot to foot
and striving and overcoming, or whether its energy be spent in a
vast labour to avoid it through exquisite evasions. Life cannot
be avoided, whether a man take all the risks and fall in the risk,
or, like the contemplative Grey, stand midst the whispering grasses
of a graveyard and sigh the years away.</p>

<p>The august and splendid old cathedral loomed out of the murk.</p>

<p>And yonder towers that thus rose above the flood! The medieval
church that builded them had founded itself on this pessimistic
denial of the fulness of life: contemning, spurning the
present; yearning for a vague, fantastic immortality. Its
litanies, its prayers, its services sounded the misery of life. To the
medieval churches this strenuous world was to produce for its
highest ideal the barren man and woman, scowling on life in a
narrow cell, shutting out the splendour of living, denying it wholly,
apologizing to its God that others dared to live the life He had
given, praying passionately that the sin of this life that God had
given might be taken upon their own poor shoulders! The free
air of heaven, and love, and the joy of life, were things to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
looked upon askance and with caution, as a part of God&#8217;s bungling;
yet so vast their faith they chanted their misereres all unwitting
of the thing they said, all unwitting of the fear lest the
future life, to which yearned their distorted hopes, might not be
as sorry a world of blunders as that which they branded with their
disapproval as God&#8217;s failure in this present seeming!</p>

<p>And where does the medieval church stand?</p>

<p>The master peoples pass its gates.</p>

<p>They preached the humble and the lowly; they preached the
prince of peace&mdash;their hands, their doors, their traditions, their
magnificent altars are bespattered with blood. With sonorous
chant and opulent prayer and incense and significant symbolism
of the worship of non-resistance, they blest the standards of battle.
They tortured kings of thought, banned the demi-gods of the
imagination, robbing woman of her parallel dignity with man,
benumbing her wits, sapping her vitality, stultifying her will,
made her a gaping hypocrisy&mdash;such women cannot be the mothers
of the Masterfolk.</p>

<p>Pah! these very stones reeked with the blood of that Eve of
St. Bartholomew. The doors of this church were scarlet with
crime. Up yonder in the haze across the river hung the bell that
had sounded in Christ&#8217;s name the cut-throat command to slay all
such as worshipped not after her fashion.</p>

<p>Asceticism is like the will of one who, fearful of the dangers of
the sea, fearful to go out on horseback to his wayfarings in the
adventures of living, fearful of tragedies that may lurk in every
thicket, became so fearful of the accidents that beset life in the
living that he shut himself up in a strong castle, its rigid walls
hewn from hardest stone&mdash;feared even to marry a wife lest she,
wearying for another less fearful than he, should put poison in his
cup. And the ship went sailing over the sea, and the horseman
went riding over the hills, and the woman married her lover and
knew life and became a laughing mother of babes, and&mdash;the castle
fell into the earthquake&#8217;s maw....</p>

<p>To such like strange music jig they who suffer the itch of
Asceticism&#8217;s distorted ideals&mdash;hermaphroditic, nay, wholly neuter.
Virginity, the fantastic virtue of virtues! They come to find
life&#8217;s glorification in the supreme denial of life&mdash;the chaste nun,
she who stands with frantic eyes at issue with her godhood that
says to her: &#8220;This is the sure and exquisite music of thy lifesong;
this is thy office this; for this thy sweet body, thy fragrant
breasts; thy every urging is touched with the finger of delicious
shame that thou shouldst know with no common thrill the majesty
of thy overwhelming significance&mdash;Be thou the mother of children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nay, does not the Ascetic even approve the ridiculous lie called
Illegitimacy? As though a child shall be illegitimate! As
though a woman shall find shame in realizing her godhood!
They that strive to be barren, alone, are the illegitimate.</p>

<p>Nay, had not the ancient churches even raised to solemn dignity
of sainthood one Anthony, whose ridiculous virtue was the dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the love of woman! for which the high God within him had
chiefly builded him.</p>

<p>Wiser far, for all their grey and vasty faults, had been the
sturdy old Protesters, rude, clumsy, bungling enough though
they were&mdash;those wise rough men who had emptied abbey and
priory of hermaphroditic ideals so that the monkish cell had given
place to the family hearth, and the clatter and whisper of inordinate
litanies to the laughter and shout of little children.</p>

<p>For the Masterfolk have no fear&mdash;neither of birth, nor of life,
nor of death.</p>

<p>Noll took the books of the wisdom of Schopenhauer out of his
pockets, and flung them from him into the river below&mdash;the pages
fluttered, beating the air, and the books that tell of the Refuge
from life in the contemplation of the Beautiful and in Asceticism,
fell upon the messy flood and were borne along on the polluted
waters of the city that went, bubbling filth, to cleanse themselves
in the immensity of the mighty deep.</p>

<p>And as the books fell, they struck the body of a dead carter that
passed in the darkness upon the tide.</p>

<p>There was law&mdash;how otherwise the evolving of the Masterfolk?
There were the heights. How to reach them?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grey towers of the cathedral took solid shape; and, beyond
and low down, the coming dawn flushed up from afar, and the
smoky heavens lifted and grew light; the vague world arose into
palpable form; and the day gained possession of the steamy city.</p>

<p>There was a footfall on the dank quays. The bohemians were
creeping home to their dingy beds to sleep away the day, turning
life upside down, making day into night, night into day&mdash;drab
symbol of their misconception of the realities.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXIX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Honourable Rupert Greppel shows Hidalgic</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a large shed in the workmen&#8217;s quarter, on a platform, under
the flare of gas-jets high hung in the dim rafters of the great place,
there sat three men at a table; and before them, languid and self-possessed,
his frock-coat close-buttoned and his scented being
attired in the general air and pose of the dandy, stood a man of
pale countenance, who, with the calm measured accents that are
the habit of self-possession, spoke to the upturned faces of a dark
mass of men that swept in a vast attentive hush from before his
feet.</p>

<p>He spoke with facile precision of thought and accent, holding
himself easily, airily, and with picturesque insolence. There was
in the air with which he spoke a quiet indifference as to whether
he pleased his hearers or not which had something of that strange
distinction that marked everything this man did or said&mdash;for
Rupert Greppel, whatever his faults, had a conspicuous and sincere
belief in his own dignity. He stood there calmly hidalgic, swaggering,
self-reliant. He never forgot, nor allowed others to forget,
that his mother was a French countess, and of the oldest of the old
noblesse.</p>

<p>He was speaking the last words of an academic appeal to
aristocratic anarchy as the solution of the great human problem.
He treated with contempt the aspirations and the beliefs in all
socialistic ideals, laughed at the good of the largest number. The
masses did not even believe in themselves, said he. The strong
man, strong in himself and of the breed of those that had belief
in themselves through the habit of generations of tyranny and of
rule, was alone fit to govern&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with all aristocrats!&#8221; cried an ugly-looking fellow at
the back of the great seething mass of listening humanity.</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel never so much as frowned. A little smile
played about his eye-pits and lips. And he was greeted with a
storm of counter-cheers from a group of students and friends,
amongst whom sat Myre and Noll and others.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot put out the aristocrat with the breath of a mere
shout,&#8221; said he calmly. &#8220;What does the State know of justice or
of equity? There is one law for the strong and one for the weak&mdash;and
there always will be.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>There was some laughter; and again counter-cheers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The State is the triumph of the individual over his fellows,
rank by rank, until the poorer spirits labour for the free spirits.
Tush! when you have a strike in this so-called Republic, the
troops are used for those that are in the right, hein?&#8221; He
laughed. &#8220;I tell you they are drawn up to strike for those that
are in power. And they are right. The commonweal demands
the public good. I am not for it. I demand rather to play gaily
with this life that is mine, as if it were mine, not this one&#8217;s, nor
another&#8217;s&mdash;I demand to play it like a gentleman, with dignity,
elegantly, artistically, free to serve my own sweet will, lusting
when I will, with whom I will, reading pleasant literature when I
would rest my body, sleeping when I would, strutting it abroad
with my clothes well-fitting, enjoying life, and looking well-dressed
for the part&mdash;I am aristocrat. As for the people let them be as
happy as they may, consistently with toil&mdash;let them have bread
and amusement on occasion&mdash;let them prate of the humanities&mdash;but
do not rack their grey minds with books. Shut the muddling
schools to them. Do not harass their vague minds and make
them pale with thinking. We can do all that for them. Let
them be industrious and well-behaved. Thought and the riot of
living are only for the aristocrat. These things but give the
people a gross headache. The peasant has stolen our acres; the
burgess has bought our strongholds. And is the world gayer?
Is it cleaner in conduct? Is it stronger in men? I say the
world is for the aristocrat&mdash;and the aristocrat has fallen from the
days when, the stag being long in the finding, we hunted a lean
peasant instead. The aristocrat being dethroned, the Jew holds
all France in his fat and grubbing hands. Is France more splendid
than it was? But one thing they have not been able to buy&mdash;our
countenance. They still have our contempt. And we yet hold
the reins of the glorious lordship of war. We still know how to
die. And until we die, when we walk abroad let the people see
to it that they give us the cleanest place if we condescend to walk
the same pavement.... But the dirty rogues encroach. The
dirty rabble ape our very vices. The people to-day have even
the impertinence to be bored&mdash;boredom is the privilege of the
aristocrat. They would leave us nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidst the laughter and the applause that rose above the swell
of the ugly growl which was the sullen voice of the great crowd
before him, he descended from the platform.</p>

<p>A restless silence fell upon the place.</p>

<p>But the massed crowd burst into a roar as a man leaped on to
the platform and stepped forward before the people&mdash;a rough
workman, energetic, vigorous, alert, dirty. This was one of those
half-educated men of action, bred by the academic unrest of the
literary anarchists&mdash;bred by the egoists, Nietzsche and other
dainty-fingered gentlemanly persons enough, who would have
been alarmed to think that their theories were breeding such
volcanoes. Into his blood had eaten their academic trifling with
extreme individualism&mdash;his fanatic eyes glowed at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
thought of his fingers about the throat of the rich&mdash;and, innately
criminal by every instinct, his nerves leaped at the murderous impulse
when he found logic was with him in his histrionic dreams of
killing.</p>

<p>The picture-loving eyes of the world are caught by the theatric
glamour of the unflinching courage that sent out the debonnair
and scented gentlemen of Versailles, beribboned and careless, to
face, with clouded canes for sole weapon, the blood-dripping and
weaponed mob of the Revolution&mdash;the romantic pulse of the grey
world is thrilled at the grim tale of the exquisites who continued
their games of cards and dice, regardless of the interruption of rude
history and with all the elaborate etiquette and fantastic ceremony
of their accustomed habit, until the command came from rough
lips that it was the turn of each to step into the jolting tumbrils
that lumbered to the scaffold and the guillotine. And indeed
theirs was a splendid feminine defensive courage, that dreaded
only the indecencies. But courage is not the privilege of a class&mdash;the
sombre garb of the workman holds often enough habitual acts
of courage, persistent and grim as that which on occasion sets the
poets rhyming if it be shown by a prince of the blood; and it
covers thereby a more virile danger, if roused to it, of turning
aggressive hands to the rectifying of its grievances, injustices, and
years of sullenly borne insolences. And if the rousing be done by
a master wit, what vast significance may be there? or what ghastly
catastrophe?</p>

<p>This fellow swung back his head to speak&mdash;and a shout greeted
him from the back of the great hall, where some ugly-looking
fellows stood:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gavroche!&#8221; cried they&mdash;&#8220;silence for Gavroche!&#8221;</p>

<p>The greeting touched the man&#8217;s conceit, and he smiled. He
laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;That scented fellow is not without eyes,&#8221; said he; and a shout
of laughter greeted him.</p>

<p>His eyes settled on his theme; and when the silence came he
burst roughly into his harangue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nietzsche has spoken the last word,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Man has
arrived above the world&#8217;s shambles by struggle alone&mdash;he is the
fittest to survive. There is no other law. The strongest shall
succeed. Existence is an anarchy; and they alone have rights
who make them. Yet man, forsooth, arriving at the top of things
by mastery, decides Nature to be brutal, forgets that he is where
he is by the ruthless selection of the fittest, and being arrived at
supremacy in Nature, he thinks to hold Nature back by overthrowing
her supreme law&mdash;he refuses to let the weak go to the
wall, refuses to leave the sick to die, hangs the strong man who
slays the weakling, and flouts the very nature which put him a-top
of the brutalities to bestride the world! But Nature is not to be
flouted. She proceeds, with contempt of all opposition, to evolve
the ultimate over-man, the Beyond-Man&mdash;the healthy, strong,
ruthless, vigorous overlord. Man is the most splendid brute&mdash;at
the base of him is the scarlet lust of war. The cultured and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
effete and the timid quake, frightened at the vision of the Beyond-Man,
not daring to acknowledge that the ruthless survive. And
to what do they appeal? to art and civilization and religion.
Well! these be pleasant toys&mdash;but in what manner have these
things been of use to make man stronger, better equipped for the
ruthless struggle for mastery, and to produce a more ruthless
breed? The day and life of the whole modern state is a lie&mdash;it
swarms with churches, mouths its creed of loving your neighbour
as yourself. But what are its <i>acts</i>? I tell you it is moved by an
aristocratic morality&mdash;a code which has no slightest intention of
loving his neighbour. There is no democracy&mdash;men are not equal,
but wholly unequal. But there is cheer for you, my comrades
of the corduroy breeches&mdash;you of the hard hands and the vigorous
life. The Beyond-Man is not of the nerveless race of puppet
kings, indeed what hath a king to-day but his robes and his fal-lals
and his fineries? The Beyond-Man is not of the enervated
crowd of hereditary nobles&mdash;like that scented apparition that has
just spoken. He is not the fat-bellied flabby burgess, grown soft
behind a counter. He is of the master-wits amongst the workers&mdash;men
whose bodies are hardened by toil, whose vigour is a live
thing from the habit of a strenuous life. It is our turn.&#8221; He
paused, and added hoarsely: &#8220;Up, then, and change the face of
the world! Up and seize the good things the gods dangle before
your eyes for the seizing. Take them as these others have taken
them&mdash;by sinew and strength of arm. Pluck from kings their
magnificence&mdash;not to give it to the aristocracy whom feudalism
created lords paramount to usurp kingship&mdash;not to the smug
burgess whom you enfranchised with your blood at the Revolution&mdash;nay,
the nobles were more picturesque and not a whit more
brutal than the trader, for the sweating-dens are many and each
hath a thousand victims for one that knew the rack, each den more
populous than the Bastille! Pluck their riches from the burgess
and hang him where he hanged the nobles&mdash;the lamp-post is still
an emblem of civilization. And if you fail a time or so, do the
prison and the frozen road of winter leave your belly more
empty than the humanitarian State? Has the felon&#8217;s cell a
harder task than such as many a worker lives in the <i>free air</i>&mdash;God
help us&mdash;the free air of this Rien-publique! Danger is the
strong man&#8217;s plaything&mdash;the whetstone of mastery. Vive
l&#8217;Anarchie!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped forward as he ended his fierce apostrophe, and
shouted it hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Vive l&#8217;Anarchie!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great throats of the workmen flung back the cry with a
mighty shout; and the students cried applause, setting their
canes rapping upon the floor.</p>

<p>The cheers set Gavroche&#8217;s conceit jigging. He stood, his heavy
face glowing in the down-flung light. The shadows played about
his eye-pits and high cheek-bones and broad nostrils and heavy
chin, and ran down the deep throat; and the light revealed the
strong jaw of the man who carries out his contentions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>But even as he stood, a big man arose in the midst of the
bohemians and students, and said in loud clear accents:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>The students shouted with laughter; and the mood of the workmen
changed, as a Frenchman&#8217;s quick subtle mind will change at
a ridiculous situation. The vast crowd burst into merriment.</p>

<p>Gavroche came down the platform, and suddenly lost the
command of himself that had given him a strange dignity during
his oration&mdash;he gave way to wild gesticulation and his voice rose
to a shrill scream, and at once became as the ravings of a maniac
to the judgment of the vast multitude. Loss of temper lost him
the ear of the house.</p>

<p>The big man, Eustace Lovegood, remained standing in calm
self-reliance&mdash;a dignity that appeals always to the essential
dignity that lies beneath the wits of all workers.</p>

<p>One of the solemn Three at the table leaned forward, rang a bell,
and asked the pleasure of the house; and when the din had ceased
he called out to the big man to go up and speak&mdash;Gavroche, said
he, had had his say and must go down.</p>

<p>Gavroche, recovering his calm, shrugged his shoulders and descending
from the platform made his way to a group of workmen
at the back of the hall&mdash;as Lovegood worked his way up to the
tribune....</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, comrades,&#8221; growled Gavroche to his fellows&mdash;&#8220;pass
the word&mdash;this fellow will speak for a full hour&mdash;he is like to be on
the side of the moralities&mdash;and they require some explaining. We
can be back here soon after. Slip away and meet by the broken
river-lamp. The watchword is <i>Rien-publique</i>&mdash;and the countersign
<i>Beyond-man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Lovegood made his huge way to the platform, there also left
the hall the engrossed figure of Quogge Myre. A great idea had
come to him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXX</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Which treats of the Masterfolk</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> big man faced the people, and squaring his great shoulders
he threw back his cloak and gazed solemnly down upon them:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a fool,&#8221; he said, &#8220;yet he spoke much truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter, and some mock cries of &#8220;Vive
l&#8217;Anarchie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfectly true that they, who are the fittest, survive in
the mighty struggle for life. The supreme law of life is the Survival
of the Best. The best are the fittest. But mark the law:
it is not the individual that survives, but the race. Thus, hadst
thou been the most exclusive aristocrat of apes, tracing thy
lineage to thy uttermost jibbering beginnings in the ooze, thou
hadst still gone under the heel of the most bucolic community of
men, though, ape to man thou hadst had the greater body&#8217;s
strength, the deeper egoism, the harder wish to slay.</p>

<p>Dominion goes to the race; it is mightier to be of the commonweal
of the Masterfolk than to hold the king&#8217;s baubles over
weaklings. To be sure, he that is king of a little people is a king&mdash;of
an Insignificance. But they that are the companions of the
Masterfolk are lords of a commonwealth that hath set its heel upon
the neck of him who rules so small a parish.</p>

<p>The Masterfolk have not their eyes upon whence they came,
but on whither they go.</p>

<p>This Gavroche fellow speaks of strength as if there were only
brute strength.</p>

<p>The Masterfolk must be free to live the fullest life.</p>

<p>To be free, the Masterfolk must be strong of thew. But this
is not enough. If strength of body made the overlord, then the
lion had been overlord to man, and the negro overborne the white
man. But man&#8217;s brain wrought the knit brotherhood of the clan
and weapons and wondrous defence and the science of war. So
the brain&#8217;s strength came to be above the body&#8217;s strength.</p>

<p>The Masterfolk, to be free, must be free in their thinking. Yet
it is not enough. For the strong man may have in body a giant&#8217;s
strength, and in thinking a giant&#8217;s strength, but, foot to foot with
them that are of his own strength, he goes down before the overlordship
of them that are strong in conduct; for he that hath not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
self-discipline, who debaucheth his powers and maketh license of
his body&#8217;s gifts and loosely scattereth his brain&#8217;s will, falls to
disease of his faculties, and his nerve grows weak, and the will,
which is the centre of life, grows enfeebled and melts to water, so
that he arouses ill-will and contempt amongst his companions;
and the enmity of his fellows blotteth him out, and his body rots.
Nature, the silent judge, sets the seal of her obliteration upon
them that she hath rejected, so that they shall not further increase
in power.</p>

<p>The Masterfolk to be free must be strong in conduct. Yet
again this is not enough. For the strong man to be free must be
strong of will. Yet even this is not enough; for the will that
acteth against the conscience becomes a bully&#8217;s strength and will
reel before it finish.</p>

<p>Through the conscience shall each man receive purification in
his search, which has been the eternal search, for the godhead
within him that leads to the fullest life. Therefore the Masterfolk
to be free must be strong in conscience&mdash;for instinct is at
the mystic centre of life. Yet even to be spiritually free is not
enough.</p>

<p>For the spirit cannot live but through the body. Therefore
the Masterfolk must be strong alike in all the freedoms&mdash;for in
each is the foundation of the other, and in the failure of each is
the obliteration of the other. Strong and alert in body, and in
thinking, and in will, and in conduct, and in conscience.</p>

<p>That man cannot be wholly free who shall ignore any of these
freedoms.&#8221;...</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Widow Snacheur comes into her Fortune</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chill murk that swept up the narrow cobbled street in the
pitchy night, swishing long wreathes of fog across the rare lamp-light,
told that the river lay close at hand.</p>

<p>It was a bitter night; and the winds buffeted out of unseen
blacknesses and squealed in a riot of unkindnesses, smiting the
face of things and falling away sullenly to smite again; the dingy
alley creaked with the complainings of shutters and lamps that
strained and jolted in their rusty hinges and grumbled in their
iron sockets.</p>

<p>A group of ill-looking fellows that whispered on the kerb under
a wall-lamp showed shadowy dark and nearly as intangible and
dim in the murky gloom as the ghostly shadows that the few
flickering lamps sent stealthily creeping across the narrow cobbled
way to join other shadows where lurked the vindictive gusts about
the edges of the moaning blackness.</p>

<p>A lilt of song and the clack of brisk footsteps came down the
alley.</p>

<p>The muttering group under the lamp turned towards the sound;
their anxious ears caught the refrain of one of Aristide Bruant&#8217;s
obscene prison songs; relief showed on the coarse faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes Gavroche,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>And Gavroche came.</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at them all.</p>

<p>His was the master spirit; yet none of these men were easily
given to obedience.</p>

<p>He laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as I thought,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Comrade Hi√©ne is pale&mdash;his
hand perspires&mdash;hold out your hand, Hi√©ne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sullen young giant put out his great hand, palm upwards,
and it smoked in the keen air of the night.</p>

<p>They all turned and stared at the tall lank youth, and his sullen
face had an ugly look, though it was of the pallor of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have drawn the lot to strike,&#8221; he said, scowling. &#8220;I have
never killed&mdash;and I do not like it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavroche laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid to kill&mdash;even an old woman!&#8221; he sneered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>A dark look came to Hi√©ne&#8217;s sombre eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet not afraid,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But ashamed&mdash;to kill an old
woman.... There is a scoundrel I know that I am not afraid
to kill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavroche shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;And this for an Overman!... Tshah!&#8221; He turned to the
others: &#8220;I had foreseen this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will do the masterwork.&#8221;
And he added with contempt: &#8220;He shall stand at the
door where the girl sleeps&mdash;for the old fool locks up the girl at
night&mdash;but the moment we leave, this fellow that fears to kill a
woman must unlock the door. Suspicion will fall on the girl.&#8221;
He turned again to the scowling Hi√©ne. &#8220;Hast thou the courage
to throw suspicion, comrade?&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>The sullen young workman made no sign.</p>

<p>One of the others moved uneasily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good comrades must not quarrel,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Gavroche laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must forestall danger,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Gavroche turned to the pale young giant:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark you, comrade,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;if the girl rouse, thou must
into the room and&mdash;kill.&#8221;... He smiled evilly. &#8220;It is all we
ask of thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he stepped close up to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;By thunder!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I think this fellow is too weak a
fool for men&#8217;s work. We had best leave him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huge young fellow met his regard unflinching, with pale
set face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where Gavroche goes to-night I go,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;if he and I
hang for it. But I do no killing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence between the two men.</p>

<p>Gavroche shrugged his shoulders; turned on his heels: &#8220;We
need have no fear, comrades; the Republic will slit his neck otherwise,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The widow Snacheur rose from her chair, looked stealthily about
her, lit a second candle-end, and went a-tiptoe to the door of the
girl&#8217;s room. She listened, cautiously turned the handle of the
door to see that the lock held, and returned to her table.</p>

<p>She changed her seat so that she could see, from where she sat,
the door into the maid&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>She brought out a bag of loose silver from a pocket in her petticoat,
poured the contents upon a piece of felt to prevent its
making a noise, and counting it into tens she made the money up
into rolls with some scraps of newspaper.</p>

<p>There was a strange look upon her withered wizened features in
the doing&mdash;it might once have been a smile, it was now something
between suspicion and greed and satisfaction. The gaunt fingers
counted the rolls.</p>

<p>Thou poor fool! what avails thee now, or has ever availed, or
shall ever avail to thy life&#8217;s enrichment, this avid culture of thy
sordid isolated self? Hast thou found life in gathering gold, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in thy wilful cruelties to the weak, or in hate as a carpet to thy
mean wayfaring, or in the lip&#8217;s protruded contempt upon thee in
thy walks abroad? God! to spend thy nine and seventy years
upon <i>this</i> journey and upon <i>this</i> travail!</p>

<p>Hearest thou no stealthy fumblings at the locks of thy outer
door? Thy gold then hath not kept thee the alert hearing in thy
ears, nor won thee the willing service of the hearing of others!
And that poor half-famished slave-girl of thine, with her fifteen
years crying out for bread, she, whom thou didst sting with thy
bitter coward tongue but this morning&mdash;she sleeps in her chill
room, heavy with the fatigue of thy overtaxings put upon a frail
ill-nourished body; she lies mute with the numbing weariness of
hunger&mdash;how shall <i>she</i> serve thee with the watch-dog ear of affection
to guard thee from harm?</p>

<p>There is a stealthy hand at thy door, and the latchet turns
slowly within the wards of thy locks.</p>

<p>A messenger stands without, and his summons none may question&mdash;thou
must needs make thy further journeyings without thy
dingy hoard, without purse or scrip, by thy lank lean shivering
self&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Ay, at last thy ears warn!</p>

<p>For a moment the old woman turned, and gazed with eyes of
terror at the coming of sudden death&mdash;and her tongue went dry
in her mouth&mdash;no sound. At the next there fell the weighted
sand-bag swung by Gavroche&#8217;s skilled hand of villainy, aimed by
his murderous eyes, and struck the ancient skull, sending the old
woman&#8217;s life jigging into the shabby room and out into the void;
and at the stroke the body, half-risen from the chair, fell across
the table amongst her moneys, sprawled ungainly midst the coins
before it further fell, and sideways lurched in a dead huddle upon
the floor.</p>

<p>To the door of the sleeping girl stepped Hi√©ne, and stood,
tall, slouching, pallid of countenance. And he so stood whilst
they all searched stealthily every nook and cranny of the
room.</p>

<p>Gavroche rose from his stooping survey of the fallen woman,
and glanced at a little mirror he held in his hand. There was no
damp of breath upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the end of <i>her</i> romance,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>He laughed low. He was a man that loved his joke.</p>

<p>He signed to the others to bring their plunder; and as they
came empty-handed except for papers, he uttered a harsh dog&#8217;s
laugh that showed embarrassment.</p>

<p>Save for the silver that lay about, the rest was the scrip of the
widow&#8217;s investments! Of considerable value, but&mdash;useless&mdash;dangerous
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse it!&#8221; said Gavroche. &#8220;She had a banking account.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a low whistle from the fellow who barred the entrance
at the outer door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said Gavroche. &#8220;Pocket what there is of money,
and we will divide later.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>He turned to Hi√©ne, where he stood before the door of the
sleeping girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;unlock that door, carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hi√©ne scowled sullenly, standing pale in the candle&#8217;s guttering
light; and they saw that he held a revolver in his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrades,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I am the last to go&mdash;and this door
remains locked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gavroche shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not matter overmuch,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hi√©ne smiled grimly.</p>

<p>Gavroche moved towards the open door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, comrades,&#8221; he said airily, putting aside a scowl that
had threatened&mdash;&#8220;we must be going. That jabbering moralist
over the water must be nearing the end of his garrulous harangue.
We had better all be seen there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had all gone, Hi√©ne let himself out of the door into
the courtyard, and stealthily closed the gate into the street.</p>

<p>The door into the girl&#8217;s room remained locked....</p>

<p>And it was so found in the early morning when the police broke
into the place, led by the curious concierge, and roused the sleeping
girl.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre struts airily
towards the Goal of Freedom</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre</span> climbed the
stairs to his rooms at midnight; and all that night he wrote.</p>

<p>When the grey of the dawn put out his lamp&#8217;s light, that wondrous
misspending energy of his had finished the essay that
brought him such an uproar of notoriety and made him for awhile
again the pet of London drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>It was a master-stroke.</p>

<p>It accounted √¶sthetically, the Nietzschian note, for his past
infamies; it gave the philosophic standpoint to the latest and
shabbiest infamy he was about to commit&mdash;for the first bound
copy of his new book lay upon the table, fresh from the publisher.
He smiled as he thought of the green eyes of Gabrielle Solignac
reading this book, reclining in her catlike grace amongst her little
smiling Eastern gods.</p>

<p>It was scarce a couple of months since he had read a volume of
Nietzsche. It had set his brain on fire. It was a revelation&mdash;of
his own possibilities. Here suddenly was revelation that his
instincts had been masterly&mdash;that he had no need for shame.
With his accustomed industry, he had forthwith mastered the
whole of Nietzsche&#8217;s published work&mdash;our Quogge was a gluttonous
reader.</p>

<p>Here was a philosophy that overthrew the whole of the accepted
ethics and morals of society&mdash;overturned the whole conception of
conduct. It made of Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre a
splendid hero&mdash;whom himself in his inner man even he had more
than suspected to be a rather scurvy fellow. His conceit and his
egoism jumped with this gospel. He foresaw that the vogue of
this aristocratic anarchism must soon spread into England&mdash;the
decaying hereditary aristocracy would leap at any straw, and
here for place of straw was a glittering argosy laden with thrones
of gold and purple, and carrying a gaudy diadem for them all. It
had begun to thrill the youth of Germany and France. He decided
to forestall it in England.</p>

<p>His great chance had come.</p>

<p>There must be no moment&#8217;s delay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>That night he had heard a French workman spout it. A workman!</p>

<p>There was indeed no time to be lost.</p>

<p>His book would be in the hands of the reviewers to-day&mdash;it
would be publicly sold in a fortnight&#8217;s time. This new philosophy
robbed its publication of all baseness. It would read as if
he had had the courage of his outlook upon life.</p>

<p>He rubbed his cold hands together....</p>

<p>He brushed his untidy colourless hair off his forehead and read
the clean copy of his essay carefully through&mdash;altered a line or
two&mdash;and folded it with a covering letter to his friend Harry Pollis,
the egregious editor of a great London Review, begging urgent
publication. There was just time to catch the post. He arose,
went out into the early morning, and posted it. Myre&#8217;s feet never
lagged in his duty to his only god.</p>

<p>When he returned to his room he looked at himself in the great
mirror over the low mantel, rubbed his hands, and smiled.</p>

<p>These two things would make a sensation!</p>

<p>He stood and gazed at himself. He took a hand-mirror and
looked at himself from every point of view.</p>

<p>He wondered if a head like his could not be the front of one as
great as Shakespeare&mdash;he wondered whether he looked like a man
who could top the world.</p>

<p>It worried him.</p>

<p>He posed so as to see the back of his head and the side-face, to
see which of the great men of the past he might be most like....
He could find no sign to guide his destiny. But his gloom was
suddenly relieved. His conceit saved him.</p>

<p>He smiled a large smile.</p>

<p>It came to him with a rush that he was wholly original.</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, posed himself in his gorgeous dressing-gown
before the mirror again, and smirked upon a pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>He dreamed of exquisite sensations.</p>

<p>He saw himself sitting in the smartest drawing-rooms, holding
himself with delightful insolence, giving voice to anarchistic
destruction of all the moralities. Art for art&#8217;s sake would be
nothing to this. He had once thought of going over to Rome&mdash;but
every mediocrity went over to Rome nowadays; it had
become positively banal&mdash;the extremity of commonplace. The
very suburbs did it! People were not even barred for it. You
went as to a dentist.... God! how he would frighten the
editors&mdash;and the women!</p>

<p>It was time, too, that he was done with France. Indeed, Mr.
Quogge Myre, who had so sworn by the French intellect and
French art, who had so flouted the vulgarity of the English nation
of shopkeepers, found that there were now so many crossing the
Channel to Paris that he realized they were discovering and exploiting
the sources of his originality.</p>

<p>He looked in the mirror. There was no slightest doubt about
it, he was becoming puffy, middle-aged, just a <i>leetle</i> bourgeois!
He wondered if he had always looked rather a common fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Tush! he had been surrendering to the bourgeois ideals&mdash;he had
married!</p>

<p>Well, the last Clatter about him had run down. He must start
another.</p>

<p>Yes, he must strike quickly in England&mdash;or they would be discovering
this Nietzsche for themselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some days after Mr. Myre&#8217;s notorious book appeared, he walked
into a caf√© frequented by literary men; and he saw that his
coming produced a sensation.</p>

<p>He went up to a table where Aubrey sat with Noll and Rupert
Greppel and Lord Montagu Askew and others; and putting his
hand on Aubrey&#8217;s shoulder he said airily:</p>

<p>&#8220;This book will give my lady her freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung the volume upon the table, and called for a bock of
beer with carefully rehearsed calm.</p>

<p>Noll took up the book, <i>She Whom I Once Loved</i>, and skimmed
through the recital, shamelessly and brutally detailed, of this
conceited fellow&#8217;s relations with women. They were of every
class....</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather vivid!&#8221; said Noll, after Myre had yawed away an hour
of time. And he added drily: &#8220;Yes; you&#8217;ll get your divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather daring, I flatter myself,&#8221; said Mr. Myre. &#8220;We
lack an English Casanova.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll rose from his seat; flung down the volume:</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh!&#8221; said he; and kicked it into the street, took up his
cigarette from the table, flicked the ash from it, and left the place.</p>

<p>Myre&#8217;s face was livid with anger.</p>

<p>The Honourable Rupert Greppel said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be blood spilt over this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaston Latour, who sat at a table near by, laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proceedings for divorce were begun in the French Courts
that day. The silent woman with the green eyes was swift when
she decided.</p>

<p>She took her freedom.</p>

<p>The book had a considerable vogue.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which Essays the High Epic Note</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day on which Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin Myre got
his freedom in the divorce-courts of France, he received a challenge
from a hot young blood called Solignac, first cousin to
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour entered the room, grimly solemn in the conventional
frock-coat and trim dress of the man of fashion, and holding
a shining silk hat in his hand. He was very careful of the
silk hat&mdash;he had borrowed it. It had the flattest brim he could
find in Paris.</p>

<p>He was followed by another solemn youth. They marched in,
clicked their heels together, bowed, and presented the letter that
held the invitation to face death at daybreak. It was all done
with a charm of manner devoid of all offence, and a desire to be
referred to two of Mr. Myre&#8217;s &#8220;friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more
like the hue of badly-made paste.</p>

<p>He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour&#8217;s sleepy eyes
never leaving him.</p>

<p>He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:</p>

<p>&#8220;A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your
cousin, Monsieur Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo
of opera-bouffe. Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.</p>

<p>Gaston Latour nudged the other youth&mdash;they bowed solemnly
and withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!&#8221; laughed Quogge Myre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following morning Mr. Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty Macloughlin
Myre&#8217;s name was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from
the list of those to which he had belonged; so it came about that
he had to live his day at caf√©s.</p>

<p>And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance
with loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about
him, vowing that he had determined to shake the dust of Paris
from off his splay feet and to start a great renaissance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
English drama, when a handsome young woman, sister to Gaston
Latour, entered the place, walked straight up to Mr. Myre, and
struck him a sounding buffet on the ear that sent his hat flying
from his head.</p>

<p>Quilliam O&#8217;Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for
the hat, she kicked him violently behind.</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round
about, and they tapped the handles of their knives upon the
tables, singing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:</p>

<p>Once for France.</p>

<p>Once for womanhood.</p>

<p>And once because she liked it.</p>

<p>The whip whistled.</p>

<p>It was said that he had been seen to strike at her&mdash;but she
parried the blow with her left, and countered between his eyes
with the butt-end of the whip&mdash;which was loaded.</p>

<p>He fell.</p>

<p>It was homeric.</p>

<p>It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled
under a table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and
as he clung to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache
so that she pulled off one side of it.</p>

<p>But she herself owned this to be as inartistic as it was unintentional,
stamping her foot with annoyance at the mischance.
Indeed, she apologized most handsomely; for, said she, pathetically,
when she had got it she did not know what to do with it.</p>

<p>It was an anticlimax.</p>

<p>She threw down the whip and said he might now go home.</p>

<p>He now went home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour&#8217;s sister hastened Mr. Myre&#8217;s desire to start the great renaissance
of the English drama.</p>

<p>As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and
shaved off the remains of his drooping moustache by the candle&#8217;s
light, and soothed the aching bumps that were risen upon his face,
he sniffed loudly through a swollen nose&mdash;he had very tender
places&mdash;and decided to go to Rouen until the hair grew.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with Blue Blood and a Jade-handled Cane</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duel got upon the town.</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel, strutting with hidalgic air, was concerned in
bringing about several affairs. No one was hurt. There was
much braying of asses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lord Montagu Askew, dainty, foppish, in the mode, and
the Honourable Rupert Greppel, hidalgic, head in air, stood before
a shop window in the Rue de la Paix and gazed at their splendid
reflections; whilst past them moved on the pavement or whirled
by in barouches the great world of Paris&mdash;<i>hig-lif</i> sunning its butterfly
wings, honey-questing, sipping at any dew that the gods
left lying abroad.</p>

<p>Montagu Askew held his jade-handled cane mincingly, and he
glowed with a gentleman-like glow, for his dove-coloured little
book of poems tinted all the bookstalls.</p>

<p>More than one woman of high rank this morning had stopped
her carriage to congratulate him on the exquisite lyric wherein
the vast firmament at break of dawn was likened to the grey of a
woman&#8217;s glove&mdash;indeed, it became the vogue of the drawing-rooms&mdash;people
sang it.</p>

<p>As a fact, Montagu Askew was acknowledged lord of chamber
music. Indeed, in his slender careful verse was no rude hint of
the full-blooded Rabelaisian love of life; it was innocent of the
suggestion of a large emotion; he played upon the accepted
measures and the well-authenticated rhyme; he startled with no
surprises; he sounded no new note&mdash;Montagu never forgot he
was a gentleman. Not for him the uncouthness to fling open loud-clanging
gates to a new world. He was pretty and serenely
mannered before everything, disdainful of them that skipped a
foot to the hot jigging blood, or such as showed a strong disdain;
nor was he wanting in contempt for the natural emotions. When
he condescended to so low an act as to seek nature, he walked
through the well-groomed spaces of the world, well-trimmed
parks at the outside, where an elaborate etiquette had made the
rules even for the trees to grow in seemliness with a most gentlemanly
existence. For him were no disturbing peerings into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
human destiny&mdash;he raised no rough alarms by strenuous aims
and vigorous thinking. Pretty, dandified, he&mdash;always. Sinning
easily enough, but always like a gentleman. Never a crudity.
As a perfumed fan fluttered by jewelled slender fingers, blowing
cool fragrant airs that kiss the painted cheek of some frail beauty,
he uttered his lines&mdash;obscene often, but by the most gentlemanly
of innuendoes. The unmannerly thing was the only sin. The display
of a profound emotion was the depth of ill-breeding. So sang
he, tunefully always, guiltless of all rough accent of originality;
sang of peacocks and green carnations and blue roses, of butterflies
and pools and dragonflies and souls, of ivory and silver, and
of dawn and dusk and dew, and white shoulders sweet, beauties
who moved languidly with rustle of silk&mdash;so wafted he to you
nothing more vibrant than whisper of women and scent of perfumed
chambers and flowers and bowers and rose and amarynth
and asphodel and daffodil, of moonlight and music and kiss and
gavotte and little tiny things&mdash;and always in the most gentlemanly
manner. He milked the unicorn. Always a would-be
suggestion of mysterious deep-hid symbolism that ended where it
began, and at most only the dark hint of well-bred tragedy.</p>

<p>He moved impatiently now, as impatiently as he might, complaining
that the shop-window into which he deigned to cast his
reflection was tinted with amethyst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Greppel,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;let us gaze at ourselves in another
window&mdash;this is an ageing colour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then came the terrible tragedy of a fire at a charity bazaar; a
most patrician function with much upper clergy in it was smitten
with sudden and awful death. Montagu Askew was in the business.
He was one of the few that came out alive.</p>

<p>In the rush of the distraught ladies, princesses, duchesses,
maids, to the sole outlet of the seething hell, Montagu Askew
got caught near the door&mdash;frantic hands of terrified women
clutched at him for help&mdash;he was almost within reach of the free
air&mdash;could see the sunlight a few paces before him&mdash;a frightened
girl clung to his arm in the awful crush, then another&mdash;women&#8217;s
skirts got under foot as they made for the door, and they went
down. He tried to shake himself clear of the two girls, he was a
little slender man.... The heat was hellish.... One of the
girls tripped on her skirt and fell, clinging to him. He beat her
down with the jade-handled cane&mdash;fought his way blindly through
the rush of women for the door&mdash;stood at last out in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Some coachmen were dashing into the fiery furnace, lifting up
and bringing out fainting women, whose muslin skirts were in
flames.</p>

<p>But Monty Askew was frightened.</p>

<p>He smoothed his ruffled dress and went home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Montagu Askew, entering a caf√© with Rupert Greppel one evening,
saluted Noll Baddlesmere, where he stood amongst a group
of students; and a silence fell upon the place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a handsome cane, Askew,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;though they tell
me the women have a poor opinion of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Askew&#8217;s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with
anger&mdash;as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:</p>

<p>&#8220;It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,&#8221; he
said&mdash;&#8220;and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin
called upon Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him
to two friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Noll&mdash;Doome was with him&mdash;&#8220;no&mdash;I do not associate
with men who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think you understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lord Montagu
Askew challenges you to fight him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,&#8221; said Noll, &#8220;that I only
brawl with men. Good-morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu
Askew harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack
of experience, is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets.
He never takes part in ungentlemanly encounters where people
are hit. Indeed, he maintains a wondrous silence, except that
he challenged Noll; and the jade-handled cane has joined the
ancestors.</p>

his Experiences into Writing</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Dear Noll,&#8221;</span> writes Horace Malahide about this time, &#8220;I have
a son. He speaks English as yet with a strong foreign accent&mdash;but
lack of experience may have more than something to do with
it. If you come, I&#8217;ll let you play with him.</p>

<p>I live in a whirl of tangled emotions in these days.</p>

<p>T&#8217;other evening I went home, to my father&#8217;s marble halls, to
seek the old gentleman on an affair of hot urgency. It was in the
long hours. I lost some temper&mdash;the butler being a sphinx of
ducal know-nothingness&mdash;so I rang up the housekeeper. Yes,
she knew where a telegram would find Sir Pompey if I would leave
it with her.</p>

<p>I!</p>

<p>Leave it!</p>

<p>Gods! said I, am I utterly disinherit?</p>

<p>Forthwith the heir of this branch of the Malahides demanded
the address.</p>

<p>It lay at St. John&#8217;s Wood!</p>

<p>I nodded &#8216;That will do&#8217; to the twain, and dismissed them;
and, they being dismissed, I whistled long.</p>

<p>Naughty old gentleman!...</p>

<p>The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed.
Evening stole on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors
of the address in St. John&#8217;s Wood from mine hansom cab.</p>

<p>I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention
as I rang.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir Pompey Malahide is here,&#8217; said I sternly to the smart
maid that opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;I desire to see my father,&#8217; said I, and marched boldly
towards the furious racket that filled the room near at hand&mdash;the
paternal roar distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried
small coal.</p>

<p>I flung open the door&mdash;burst upon the riot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three
children rolling over him&mdash;three, no less!&mdash;another in his arms&mdash;Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Pompey Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a
she-bear, his coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his
teeth, and growling like an ass in pain&mdash;and seated on the immaculate
waistcoat of the dark mysterious Bartholomew the
most beautiful young woman I have ever seen. The din infernal&mdash;and
Pa the worst part of the din.</p>

<p>&#8216;What does this mean, Pa?&#8217; cried I.</p>

<p>They gathered themselves up, shamelessly&mdash;laughed&mdash;ye
gods, twittingly, at <i>me</i>! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself
into comfort in his clothes, slapped me upon the back:</p>

<p>&#8216;Horace, my son&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t be familiar, Sir Pompey,&#8217; said I. &#8216;You are speaking
to the heir to a baronetcy.&#8217;</p>

<p>The baronet laughed vulgarly:</p>

<p>&#8216;Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,&#8217; he said&mdash;&#8216;allow me to introduce
to you Horace, my son&mdash;at least, my reputed son.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bows, chass√©es, and greetings.</p>

<p>&#8216;Horace&mdash;the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and
Master Oliver Doome&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with
mighty hand that near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.</p>

<p>He dug me in the ribs:</p>

<p>&#8216;The rogue&#8217;s been married this seven years,&#8217; cried he; &#8216;and
now he&#8217;s signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and
you&#8217;re just in the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs&mdash;only&mdash;look
here, Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not
to touch the business arrangements&mdash;you and he would wreck the
counting-house in six months....&#8217;</p>

<p>Doome took an early opportunity to draw me aside and to
whisper to me the grave disappointment it must be to all who respected
him if they should discover the real Don Juan, begged me
not to expose him, and pointed out the serious loss of prestige he
must suffer in the eyes of the British Public; so we sat down
together on a sofa and pitied him for his decencies.</p>

<p>Luddy, luddy! how the homely virtues will persist!</p>

<p>The idol of our youth, the dark, mysteriously wicked man&mdash;with
feet of honest clay and a clean simple heart after all! Even
prolific, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, damn romance, say I....</p>

<p>Oh, and more!</p>

<p>Even the gods fall out&mdash;drift apart.</p>

<p>Aubrey and the O&#8217;Myre go different ways&mdash;Aubrey in pain
that O&#8217;Myre has now discovered that there is no great work of art
without a moral purpose&mdash;Aubrey holding that Aubrey himself is
sufficient purpose. He, Aubrey, avers that he has found himself&mdash;nothing
matters after that. He must back to Paris. There the
women have secular lips and voices of brocade and understand
being loved. Tiens! He will in future give his splendid talents
to attack the Philistinic brutality of strength and the barbarity
of the over-rated glory in mere outdoor delight that to-day holds
England in poisonous embrace; in all the pride of effeminacy he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
withdraws into the palace of his Egoism, where he is lord&mdash;back
to Paris&mdash;<i>there</i> are mirrors, where he may reflect upon himself,
take himself up by the roots and dwell upon his own image!</p>

<p>I expect he will come back to us occasionally to see what he
looks like.</p>

<p>The egregious O&#8217;Myre also hath descended on London town&mdash;stays,
however, but a little while&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet a wondrous thing of a man, the O&#8217;Myre&mdash;the most consistent
surely of all created things&mdash;always wrong. He and <i>The
Times</i>. He must have been suckled on half-truths, and nurtured
on the Irish Bull; he now browses on false conclusions. But
with what an air! Nevertheless, he has it all on the most philosophic
basis&mdash;has for ever been blaming something for his lack of
greatness. It now appears the English drama is dead. The
O&#8217;Myre will breathe new life into it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he has laid it down, like a minor god with a
throaty tenor voice, that scenery destroys the illusion of the
drama&mdash;therefore it comes about to-day that if you would be in
the vogue with the ladies you must go in state not to the play, but
to the dress rehearsal&mdash;the bare theatre and the dinginess being
alone at back, the low tone and the cobwebs and the like giving
mystery to the spoken word that requires for enunciation but
beautiful lips. God! how the ducks quack!</p>

<p>Thus mews he much monstrous wisdom, sitting like a pale
emotional maggot upon the apple of discord that is called the
modern drama.&#8221;...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the letter is a matter of affection and goodwill. A
man is always ridiculous about his first-born&mdash;exaggerative,
egotistical. As though he had invented the business. Whereas,
like heredity, immortality, and the latest fashion, it is thrust upon
us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero, and Another, go Home</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sunlight that had painted the white face of Paris with a
hundred hues all day had given place to a gentle drizzle as the
twilight fell; and the steady downpour had driven Noll into a
restaurant which he was not in the habit of frequenting; it had
kept him there in its bright rooms until he knew every face and
every trick of gesture of the people who sat about him.</p>

<p>The night was well advanced when he sallied out into the light
rain; turning up his collar, he strode homewards.</p>

<p>He paid small heed to the rain; and as he turned out of the
well-washed street into the courtyard where he had his lodging,
and climbed the stairs to his room, he scarcely noticed that he was
wet.</p>

<p>The rustle of women&#8217;s petticoats was in his ears, and when he
walked abroad in these days he was aglow with the sense of the
warm regard of women&#8217;s eyes, that glanced upon him from the
dark shadows of rakish hats; the walk and movement of women
found a rhythmic echo in his thinking. The warmth of the
coming summer was in his blood. His instincts were jigging to
the dancing measure of the season.</p>

<p>As he flung off his wet clothes he was seized with a whim to go
to the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>; and he decided to humour the
whim.</p>

<p>He lit a candle and flipped through a book until it was close on
midnight. But he was restless&mdash;and he arose eagerly when it was
time to go....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that
led into the tavern of <i>The Golden Sun</i>, a young woman in black
came languidly down the stairs, and he held the door open for her
to pass in.</p>

<p>The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled
with pleasure, seeing him.</p>

<p>They entered and stood together&mdash;a song was being sung&mdash;and
as the last chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm;
and he left it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll
received from the faded poets and frequenters of the place. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
was very beautiful&mdash;but her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed
a dizzy tendency to cling to his arm, as though she feared to fall.
He found a table, and made her sit down beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madelaine,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you look as if you wanted food.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&mdash;for years,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they
were being brought, he asked her:</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of you, Madelaine&mdash;after the old widow
Snacheur was killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to work in a millinery shop.&#8221; She shrugged her
slender shoulders. &#8220;They starved me too,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;just like
the widow Snacheur. So&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped her hand through his arm, laid her head against his
shoulder, and smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;But do not let us think of these things&mdash;it is so warm here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The touch of the affectionate hands, the childlike caress of the
girl, the confidence and the clinging of her warm body to him,
thrilled him. She was in all the fresh beauty of her young womanhood;
and the simple black gown, threadbare and worn as it was,
only enhanced the beauty of her skin and pronounced the delicacy
of her colour and the richness of her splendid hair.</p>

<p>The girl increased the restlessness that had possessed the youth
all day. She brought to him the sweet whiteness and the subtle
grace of Betty&mdash;filled his senses with the atmosphere of the handsome
girl who had filled all his dreams from boyhood. It brought
to him the most importunate craving of man, the love of woman.</p>

<p>Noll sat brooding for awhile. Yet even in the vigorous lust of
life that held his young years, even as he sat there in the thrill of
his sweetest memories, he vaguely felt the gentle presence of these
simple faded artistic folk about him; and he realized how indelibly
the word Failure was written across them all. The coats
were, if anything, more faded; the shoes more worn; the eyes
alone lit up with the wonted glow of delight in art. A little praise
was their rich barmecidal feast.</p>

<p>The greybeards, and the youths, and those between, they were
all still hoping to create the masterpiece&mdash;there was not, amongst
them all, energy enough to create more than the delicate measure
of a gust of chamber-music.</p>

<p>A burst of applause followed the recital of a poem.</p>

<p>Noll roused with a start:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Madelaine,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;this heavy air is making you
faint. Come with me and we&#8217;ll have some supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gathered her skirts with wonted grace of gesture and took
his arm; and they made their way out of the room almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit
passage, drew down his face to her between her two hands, and
kissed him.</p>

<p>She clung to him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>&#8220;Thou must give me a bed too,&#8221; she whispered hoarsely; &#8220;I
have no bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tired, Madelaine,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had no sleep for three nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I walked about the streets,&#8221; she answered simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must first sup.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his
arm. They climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street,
and out into the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.</p>

<p>It was a sadly simple undressing.</p>

<p>She was languid with sleep.</p>

<p>Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below
him, blinking her thousand eyes....</p>

<p>He roused and went to the bed.</p>

<p>The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Noll went back to the window&mdash;it was the window from which
Horace had gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and
Betty had come to Paris.</p>

<p>And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems
of his life, the night slowly passed.</p>

<p>The rustle of a woman&#8217;s skirt had been in his ears all day&mdash;in
his blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the
fragrance of his marriage.</p>

<p>And this beautiful winsome girl&mdash;what was to be the end?</p>

<p>The very question sobered him.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was as though he had left the din of the noisy
thoroughfare of life and had entered the majestic silence of a
mighty cathedral; and from the great mysterious deeps a whisper
came to his ears, each syllable roundly phrased, clear, unhesitating,
a chapter of this strange book of life that he had so lately
read&mdash;the book that had fired his blood and aroused his energy.
The breath of these pages seemed to give him decision and free
air, where before he had been drifting aimlessly, going he knew not
whither, caring not overmuch. This book had braced him&mdash;it was
a call to battle. He had had enough of beds of roses and daffodils
and idyllic trances. The phrasing of <i>The Masterfolk</i> came to
him now:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nature has ordered that certain things shall be; and to him
who disobeys her ordering she is cruelly merciless. She has decreed
that he shall be most dominant, shall breed the fittest race,
shall know the fullest life, shall achieve the highest destiny, who
abides by the woman he loves. And him who is unclean she flings
upon the dunghill&mdash;him and his seed for ever. Of the love of man
for woman, Nature has spoken with no uncertain voice; and
Nature&#8217;s judgment is final. He that fears to love a woman sets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
himself against the supreme law of life; he ends in unnatural
vice; he is against the design of life; celibacy Nature will none
of&mdash;for celibacy stultifies life and ends the race. Promiscuous
love she condemns utterly and punishes heavily with loathsome
disease and with foul decay; the races of promiscuous love are
become of the scum of the earth, and are dying out. Against the
love of many women also, once and for all, she has spoken. The
peoples of many wives Nature is sweeping into the waste corners
of the world. Nature is her own jury&mdash;Nature alone her own
judge. She hath not said the Masterfolk cannot break from her
ordering, but that they shall not. On every breach of her vigorous
laws Nature waits with weaponed hand. At the elbow of every
vice stands foul-breathed disease.</p>

<p>There is no sin in the love of man and woman. The woman has
committed no sin in loving&mdash;she has but accepted the overwhelming
urging of life. It is her chiefest glory. Man has committed
no sin in loving; his life has ordered it; and the Masterfolk
obey life. It is his chiefest glory. Who so glum a dullard
but smiles to see lovers meeting! But he sins foully who is guilty
of the repudiation&mdash;foully against the woman, criminally against
his race, blasphemously against his godhood, and damnably
against his manhood. Such are not of the Masterfolk.</p>

<p>They of the inferior manhood, lacking in the force of character
necessary to the full acceptance of the duties of the Masterfolk in
love, have not the virile force to abide by a woman of the Masterfolk;
and these come out when the lamps are lit and there are
shadows in the land, and skulk about the by-lanes, and commit
mean adulteries with frail women, and have the habit of repudiating
debt. Such cannot breed the Masterfolk. They shall not.
For these cower from the strengthening risks that dog a strenuous
life; they would have the delight of marriage without the
courage....&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll opened the window.</p>

<p>There came from the street below the hoarse cry of a prostitute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He went into the room, lit a candle, and sat down at his desk.
Everything in the place whispered of Betty this night.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Madelaine</span>,</p>

<p>I am called home.</p>

<p>I leave my rooms and all in them to your care, knowing that
they will be in good hands. I leave you also all the money I can
spare, to keep you in decency and comfort until I return.</p>

<p>I shall send, early in the day, for the large leather bag which
you will find labelled and ready by the door.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Noll.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Babette</span>,</p>

<p>I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday.
By the time you get this letter I shall have left my house in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
clouds. Last night I found Madelaine at <i>The Golden Sun</i>. She
was without home, without means, except the sweating pay of
mean industries on which no honest woman can live; she was
without a bed. But her blood is dancing with life&mdash;not with a
desire to cower in sweating-dens. She was drifting. I gave her
all these things that I might, last night&mdash;and she is now asleep
here.</p>

<p>Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she
is not alone. She will babble all her news to you&mdash;it will be better
for her than babbling it to me.</p>

<p>Tell Horace not to go back to the haunts of his youth. The
wine is not nearly so good as we thought it. The illusion is the
sweet thing. Don&#8217;t break the butterfly.</p>

<p>Tell him also that both of you have much of my heart.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">Yours,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Noll</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am tired of myself. I am off to find Betty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Noll sealed the letter and wrote a third&mdash;to the concierge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,</p>

<p>I am called away to England. Mademoiselle Madelaine
Le Trouv√© has been good enough to take charge of the rooms until
madame and myself return. Pray give the enclosed to your little
ones &#8216;from the Englishman who knows how to laugh.&#8217;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright2">Agr√©ez, etc.,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oliver Baddlesmere</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He stole to where Madelaine slept, and on the chair by her bed
he put her letter and some banknotes.</p>

<p>He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his
large leather kit-bag, and carried it to where the candle gave light.
From the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two
trinkets, and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went
into the bag.</p>

<p>He was near singing more than once. The place was astir with
the sound of Betty&#8217;s skirts, the echo of her gaiety, the sound of
her light footstep. The air was sweet with the breath of her uncomplaining
good-nature.</p>

<p>He shut up the bag, tied a label upon it, put on his cloak and
hat, blew out the candle, and softly let himself out of the room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the darkness Noll stood upon the bridge at the end of the
Boule Miche, the pleasant highway of youth. But he now knew
no indecisions.</p>

<p>He realized that his mere intellect had led him into the veriest
pedantries&mdash;had nearly led him into irretrievable blunders. He saw
that man&#8217;s highest was rooted in the body, that heaven was no
fantastic dream, but here and now for the winning on this healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
brown earth. He had been letting it slip by him, whilst he
dreamed of pasteboard nothingnesses.</p>

<p>He realized that the emotion felt was nearer to the centre of life
than all thought. He cast from him the devil of mere intellect,
and it went out of him demurely into the darkness, like some poor
thin-souled nun, who crushes down into barrenness the splendid
emotions of the life within her which are her very godhood, in
fantastic hope to win an eternity of vague bliss, she who by the
very act shows her inability to enjoy bliss&mdash;for, heaven and hell
and all the eternities shall yield her no such bliss as the dear human
loves may do&mdash;the √¶ons of immortality shall never bring her the
delight that she might know in an hour of a lover&#8217;s embrace or the
dear touch of a nestling child at her lean breasts.</p>

<p>As the awakened youth stood there, the black night passed over
the edge of the populous city, and its smoky shadow slowly followed
it. The lights of the lamps paled in the dawn; the stars
went out; and out of the daffodil east the day came up&mdash;and
there was light in the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the day was well begun, Noll went home.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span><span class="gap">*</span></p>


<p>In the still grey dawn, in dripping drizzle, Gavroche the anarchist
slouched forth from prison-cell to his harsh doom.</p>

<p>He was dejected.</p>

<p>He missed the band, the public eye, the shouts of the comrades.</p>

<p>What, Gavroche! this is thy dramatic moment&mdash;thou hast the
stage all to thy sole swaggering self&mdash;and though thou roused at
daybreak from thy broodings to lilt a braggart song with all thy
best intent to play the reckless swashbuckler, the florid eager
pressman can only report that thou didst sing &#8220;somewhat
palsily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tush, man! Is it thus thou goest to thy end? Hath thy desire
to be Ruthless Overman brought only this about&mdash;that thou art
to become no better than manure? Where is now thy dream of
Ruthless Overman? Nay, what avails at all now thy Overmanhood,
Gavroche? does not thy neck feel rather with unpleasant
shiver of discomfort the overlordship of the Commonweal? The
aristocrat despised it yesterday, and thou to-day. Hast thou,
even thus late, a glimmering that thy vaunted Ruthless Brutality
is to be snipped by the might of this Commonweal, thy unspeakable
windpipe slit at a stroke of the ordered shear that falls on the
bidding of that overwhelming force which is the public good&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
power of that sneered-at race that is to thy silly little individual
hand&#8217;s strength as the might of the sea to the spite of some flab
stinging medusa!</p>

<p>Yet, if the insignificance of thy little petty self irk thy conceit
at this moment, what of the scented, gloved, and dandified gentlemen
who write the anarchic words that have led thy conceit to
seek some shabby fame in flinging a bomb amongst innocent
people! What of them whose lyric pens have pointed the way to
the Uselessness of the old and sick and far-too-many and superfluous
ones! What of them that go scot-free&mdash;whose philosophies
led thee to kill the old miser-woman and to slay the drunken carter
to thine own Egoism&#8217;s enrichment? Tsh! thou wert but a tool
after all, thou with all thy strange gabble of Ruthless Overman,
putting to the touch of practice what the gloved gentlemen were
content to prate of&mdash;Might being Right and the rest.</p>

<p>Well, thou goest to thy dunghill alone&mdash;they to their social
triumphs. And, when all&#8217;s said, the aristocratic ideal has brought
rich harvests as well as the shearing of necks to its idolaters&mdash;and
they have had their emotional moments in intervals of starving
the race and filching from the poor and from the widow and the
fatherless.</p>

<p>Nay, doth not Europe, bereft of protestations, bow, hat in
hand, to the Almanach de Gotha? And the fine gentry therein,
weak-knee&#8217;d and inbred and ridiculous, do they not claim divine
rights and special places reserved in church and the tribute of the
Formalities all set and square to their comical little greatnesses?
And multitude of lackeys!... Gods! are they not even
Envied!</p>

<p>Verily, Gavroche, thou hast been lacking in the diplomacies.
It is that which has been thy chief offence against thyself. These
others bray as loudly&mdash;but the accent is more tuneful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, the same dawn, the self-same lamp of day, sees us all going
each on our so different way.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which has to do with the Binding of Books in Half-calf and the
Whimsies of Calf Love</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Noll had left his baggage in a quiet hotel by the Strand, and
had refreshed his body with much splashing of himself in water and
a change of clothes, he sallied out into the streets of London in a
vague wonder and surprise as to how to begin the search for Betty,
yet firmly determined to start straightway in his quest&mdash;the
Baddlesmere jaw set firm.</p>

<p>The summer afternoon was closing in, and the Strand was gay
with people cheerily making their way homewards from work or
amusement. But homewards Noll did not take his steps; he felt
a certain sense of shame about going to his own people without
Betty at his side&mdash;and this, too, not on his own account, but that
it seemed disloyal to Betty and likely to make her future entrance
into the family circle an embarrassment to her&mdash;so sudden was
the suddenness with which he had stepped into the realm of his
manhood!</p>

<p>The young fellow had been too restless to stay in the dingy mute
rooms of the hotel; he could think it out better in the open&mdash;striding
to his thinking. It was in the blood&mdash;he smiled at the
restless walk of Lord Wyntwarde up and down that library, of the
strange trick that came out in his mother at times....</p>

<p>Ah, London, thou queen of cities, that filchest for ever the hearts
of them that dare to love thee! Radiant in thy sunshine, fantastic
in thy murk, it is when thou puttest on the habit of thy lilac
twilight that thou showest all thy majesty&mdash;thy tiring maids, the
handsomest women of the world, helping thee to thy wondrous
mantle of many hues&mdash;pale whitenesses and opal greys, beribboned
with purple and ultramarine and the sooty tinge of
dusky shadows, adorned with diamonds of a hundred flames and
wrought through and through with gold and silvery strands, and
thus and so, with smoky art, spinning thyself a mystic robe that
it is full fit only the Queen of all cities shall wear.</p>

<p>And what a splendid stage, thy realm, to strut it in! Thy large
drama knows no curtain, thy magnificence no boundary but man&#8217;s
narrow sight. Thy whisper and the song of thee, and thy strange
melodies, no strings of violins nor the resounding hollows of deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
orchestral &#8217;cellos can yield. From the music of thy ways, where
goes thy multitudinous traffic with roll of many wheels, and lurches
the gaudy omnibus with reeking horses twain, and lumbers the
thundering dray, and winds in and out the teeming welter the
quick black hansom seeking the hackney fare, with jigging of
horse-bells that sound a catchy measure to the shuffle of many feet,
from out thy swarming hive there comes the breath of vigorous life
and thinkingness and the atmosphere of quick wits and alert wills
that have the habit of decisive action and of dogged enthusiasms.</p>

<p>And the faces that pass, with lingering glance out of the dusk,
the pale sweet faces of thy beautiful women and the handsome
figures of a vigorous race, how much larger vastnesses are in the
communion of these eyes than in wide empty spaces of unthinking
continents!</p>

<p>The mystic dusk turns thy many habitations to a thousand
shadowy palaces, thy very vulgarities to dulcet musicalities.
What comedies are in the making in thy wide hospitable lap to-night!
what tragedies! what heroic strivings! what bemeaning
indecencies! what crimes!</p>

<p>Thy very mud holds something of dark mysterious lustre&mdash;being
that which is trod out of thy pageant and thy history.</p>

<p>He only loves thee best who, being divorced from thee, comes
to thee again out of the years. He flips thy mantle with no
cockney familiarity, but hears in the hollows of his reverent ears
the √¶olian whisperings of thy large significance....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps ceased to rouse the echoes in the empty
street, as Noll came to a halt before Netherby Gomme&#8217;s doorway.
He hesitated for a moment; ran up the steps; and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The smoky twilight that held the place was passing into sooty
darkness, turning the staid street of lodging-houses into a way of
fairy habitations, the lemon flames of gas-lamps showing a sweeping
curve of light down its long length to the far rumble of the
city&#8217;s distant traffic.</p>

<p>A key coughed in its wards as it shot back the bolts of the lock;
and the door yawned open.</p>

<p>Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.</p>

<p>The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the
doorway; and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.</p>

<p>Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting
with a grave smile of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking
into the corners of the old mouth again:</p>

<p>&#8220;He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;will
you go up and see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him
with a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the
little sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly
figure of the little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room
and kissed the jealousy out of this old woman&#8217;s heart, came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
to him like the fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he
could not speak what he would have said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only the other day,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you were boys
together.... To me it is only yesterday that he was a&mdash;little
one&mdash;in my&mdash;arms.&#8221; Her eyes filled with tears. &#8220;But it is all
gone.... This passing of youth is as strange as death....&#8221;
And she added after awhile: &#8220;I think he&mdash;was glad&mdash;to come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the
old tear-stained face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Julia?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,&#8221; she said
drily. &#8220;They will want amusing badly to-night&mdash;and the tuning
of the fiddles would always rouse my Netherby.... But you&#8217;d
better go up and see him, Noll&mdash;you used to know the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how
he and Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the
attic door.</p>

<p>In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head
in his hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby
Gomme, sobbing pitifully.</p>

<p>Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, Netherby!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gripped his hand upon the other&#8217;s shoulder, affectionately.</p>

<p>Gomme signed him to a seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Noll&mdash;I&#8217;ll be all right in a minute.&#8221; He blew his
nose. &#8220;No&mdash;better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will
not bring back one&#8217;s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done.
Light up! A man can only cry comfortably in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet;
and the gas leaped into flame.</p>

<p>The old attic was gone.</p>

<p>In its place was a picturesque medieval room of quaint nooks
and demure corners, with stiff wooden settles of curving line
against the wall, and low bookshelves round the rest of the walls;
and above, on a deep coloured frieze under the low ceiling, was a
long space of rigid trees from the land of Morris, green trees that
yielded vasty purple and golden fruits on close-bunched foliage&mdash;and
in the blue intervals between the stilted trees sailed white-sailed
many-coloured galleons and purple triremes&mdash;and on the
wall beneath the frieze and above the long curves of the low bookshelves
was a yellow space splashed with huge orange-coloured
dogs, with emerald eyes and scarlet mouths, that leaped along on
hind legs to the chasing of each other and an occasional orange
stag amidst mighty flowering plants that seemed to whirl in
autumn tints with cunning running lines half-flower, half-leaf.
And here and there was a knight in armour, and a hawk upon his
wrist, and clothes upon his horse, and about him was always
written <i>Soe sirre Gallahydde gotte hyme pryckynge to hys pilgrymmynges</i>;
and when the knight was faded blue the writing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
russet green; but when the knight was russet green the writing
about him was faded blue. And here and there was a lady with
hair in plait, and she wove at a loom, and sang with ruddy lips,
and the writing about her was <i>Chaunted the Queene ande weaved
hyre tale righte Fyttyngelye</i>; and when the queen was orange
yellow the writing was white, and when the queen was white the
writing was orange yellow. The old bookshelves, with their gay
untidiness of many-coloured books, were gone; and in their place
in more severe order on dark oaken bookshelves of suave design
were ranked books all bound exactly alike in uniform yellow half-calf
bindings. The floor was rich-stained and polished, and in the
middle of it lay a rug of the yellow of saffron.</p>

<p>The old attic was now so rich of hue and yet so stiffly chaste
that Noll almost rubbed his eyes to see if he were awake.</p>

<p>It was indeed a handsome room; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Some faint whisper of the how and the why these things had
chanced flashed through Noll&#8217;s consciousness. Here Julia had
put the savings of her hard-won earnings. A tidy mind frets at
the ordered disorder of the workshop. She was of a precise habit
that has a ruthless distaste for chips. She had secretly consulted
the old lady, who had grimly advised her to &#8220;let the man&#8217;s room
be&#8221;; but he who takes to the council of war a decided intention
is irked by opposition, and smiles away the wisdom of older heads
as the mere caution of senility. And indeed there was something
of the poetic intention behind her gentle obstinacy, as there was
behind everything she did; for (and she knew it in her secret
heart to be not wholly without a little of such jealous venom as her
gentle blood could hold) she had been passionately set upon bringing
into this man&#8217;s life a fresh influence, a fragrance that she was
sure he had not known&mdash;she was aglow with the glamour of the
love-mood to be the all-in-all in the atmosphere of her lover&#8217;s day.
And as the rich crave ever to be more rich, so she, queening it in
her little parish, was blind to the simple fact that all the subtle
and gracious tenderness of her gentle womanhood had won her a
larger empire over her lover than any she could hope to win by
petty endeavour. The old lady, her wise old eyes seeing that the
other had come to consult the oracle with the answer rather than
the question, had nodded her willingness, after the first demur,
to comply with the younger woman&#8217;s whim. And the nod of surrender
once given, she had addressed herself, during their absence
on the honeymoon, to carrying out the young wife&#8217;s instructions
to the uttermost detail, even employing no small sum out of her
own small income to the perfecting of it.</p>

<p>And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light
ordering&mdash;it was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel
whips; for, as each change obliterated a footprint of the past, the
atmosphere in which the boy and man had wrought their career
swiftly vanished&mdash;the very hint of an early struggle had departed
from the place.</p>

<p>Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face
as he leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
to its old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from
his beloved things.</p>

<p>Noll&#8217;s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent
shoulders of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that
the other had digested the situation.</p>

<p>He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Julia!&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220; she must never know. She has done
this during our absence&mdash;as a surprise. And,&#8221; he added grimly:
&#8220;it was!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You
are famous, man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes&mdash;quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner&mdash;without
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll put out the light:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat
many a day and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed
at care here; and kicked the world about like a football, and
striven to dig up the roots of the Universe&mdash;the Why and the
Wherefore and the Whence and the Whither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netherby sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll, the old room is gone. I have to begin all over
again. These stiff prude seats compel me to order&mdash;tell me
harshly that I must not be dreaming overmuch, nor thinking&mdash;which
is next door to dreaming&mdash;but nag me to be up and doing,
boiling pots or eggs or hitting something or pushing at things. I
don&#8217;t seem to fit in anywhere. The medieval rigours warn me to
be done with visions and the reading of the visions of others; and
their hard oaken seats rise up and assault me where I would sit
upon them.... But that is nothing. They have left me not
even my books. I am bewildered&mdash;bewildered&mdash;wholly bewildered.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed sadly, and went on:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll, he only knows the whole delight of having possessed
a child who has lost it.... Books are one&#8217;s most intimate
friends&mdash;they never change&mdash;never play us a shabby trick. How
they eat into one&#8217;s friendship, each dressed in his individual habit!
the very ugliness of some a reason for seeking to win their confidence;
perhaps a reason for an easy familiarity&mdash;we dog-ear
them the more&mdash;mark them the more&mdash;love them the more. Put
them in handsome ranks uniform, and their individuality is gone&mdash;like
sisters that are primly arrayed to the same pattern to
simper through a tedious garden-party. We begin to find faults
where was once only affection; and their outward seeming being
now alike, like critics we seek to taste not the delights within, but
carp because this has not Shakespeare&#8217;s wit nor that the thunders
and the music of Carlyle. These that were once our closest, most
garrulous, most intimate friends have gone to join the silent ranks
of library editions that no one reads. These stiff and formal backs,
these ornamental edges, these dandified and dyed airs, repel me
from my ancient friendships. The intimacy of years is broken&mdash;frozen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
They open no longer eagerly at the old accustomed
places, stained with frequent thumbings, where my own hand cut
the dear intimate leaves&mdash;they are deckle-edged and bedamned
and horrible which were wont to be delightfully impertinent. I
cannot find my way in the old garden that I loved&mdash;the old dog-ears
are smoothed out, gone&mdash;my pencillings erased, their whisperings
mute, they nudge my elbow no more. These, my one-time
boon companions snub me; give me but the flabby handshake
of necessity. They open their houses to me mincingly, and
yawn affected utterance. They no longer tickle me in the ribs,
touching me on the sleeve, nor beckon; they do not chuckle
familiarly&mdash;nor brood with me upon the roll and march of the
great significancies. Their new clothes are insistent&mdash;upon them
as upon me. They smell of the oil of respectability like gagged
Sunday-school children. We know each other no longer&mdash;except
with formal bow and elaborate etiquette&mdash;as when a royal person
enters the room of entertainment and puts good-fellowship to the
rout.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a pause, and, passing his gaunt hand over his brow,
he added sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come home to find myself in a strange land....
Shining-faced respectability has usurped my chair.... My
kingdom has slipped from me.... The flowers in my garden
are dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll patted him on the back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, man&mdash;you have come into a new kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard Julia&#8217;s voice upon the stair; and he saw that the
other had heard it, for he stood up and forced a smile upon his
long sad face.</p>

<p>Noll went close to him hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;One word, Netherby&mdash;quick, before she comes&mdash;do you know
where Betty is?&#8221; he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>Netherby smiled a sad smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Noll, that <i>you</i> should have to ask <i>me</i> that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.</p>

<p>As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went
into the old lady&#8217;s room. She was sitting in the window, looking
out; and she turned at his footfall.</p>

<p>Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the
harsh light had gone out of her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you be a little lonely here to-night?&#8221; Noll asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;she has taken seats for all three of us.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXXVIII</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is suspected that, on Occasion, the Trumpet of Fame is
not Wholly Immaculate of the Hiccup</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pangbutt&#8217;s</span> handsome studio had been cleared for a reception;
and the deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors,
walked stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye
round the brilliantly lighted details in a last complacent survey
before the near arrival of the guests.</p>

<p>He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his
watch:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they are arriving early enough!&#8221; said he. &#8220;It comes
of arsking these here artists to the house.... They&#8217;re always
hungry and they&#8217;re always noisy, and they&#8217;re always thirsty.
Even if I suffered from these here afflictions I&#8217;d have the manners
not to show it.&#8221; He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I call it letting
ourselves down. They don&#8217;t even know how to put on their
clothes like Christians.&#8221;</p>

<p>He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,&#8221; he
growled....</p>

<p>He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
doorway, ushering in four guests.</p>

<p>When they had entered, he said stiffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes,
gentlemen; he has only just come in to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it
aggressively.</p>

<p>Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;We <i>are</i> a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,&#8221; said he, going up
to the dignified old man&mdash;&#8220;but if Mr. Rippley <i>will</i> insist on
sitting between the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby
drives hard to escape the inquisitive attention of the police&mdash;a
body of men, Dukes, that live feverishly anxious to catch something
and are bored with the greyness of the popular virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.</p>

<p>The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew.</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and
surveyed it:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;portrait painting seems to pay, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m&mdash;n&#8217;yes,&#8221; he grunted; and added tragically: &#8220;When
you can paint portraits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair.</p>

<p>Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights;
his hands itching to be at any devilment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover
the real Anthony Bickersteth&mdash;the man of mystery&mdash;the
writer of <i>the</i> book!... I suppose it ain&#8217;t Pangbutt himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey at the mantelpiece, gazing at himself in the mirror,
said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it,
eh?&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair.</p>

<p>Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the
situation with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:</p>

<p>&#8220;And a rippin&#8217; dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one&#8217;s self being
wrangled about from one end of the country to the other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, &#8220;and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley laughed drily:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Aubrey, old man&mdash;that wouldn&#8217;t have suited you at
all. You wouldn&#8217;t have lasted at it for a fortnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,&#8221; he
said in his big deep voice: &#8220;We shall be tearing him to pieces in
magazine articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the
lower journalism to snarl at before the year is out.... The
failures are always suspicious of popularity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey turned to the mirror again, and said &#8220;Bosh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth&#8217;s work is a
snap better than Caroline Baddlesmere&#8217;s; and he&#8217;s prigged a lot
of her ideas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque
literary attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long
fingers, legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the
thirties, and, rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that
Caroline Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man&#8217;s humour&mdash;to
say nothing of that certain something of subtle atmosphere
that is called genius.... You really ought not to give me the
trouble of reiterating these simple truths.... You compel me
to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker on a race-course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering
in Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte&mdash;Andrew in very
much crushed and wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably
shabby, Doome well groomed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>Bartholomew Doome laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;yes, yes&mdash;I heard what Aubrey was saying;
but Aubrey is a poet, not a critic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.</p>

<p>But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte.
He smote him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Andrew,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was
very pale:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221; he asked gloomily.</p>

<p>Rippley laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all before our welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte sighed, and said absently:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.&#8221;
He smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: &#8220;I
came into my Irish estates last night&mdash;took over the keys of my
castle in Spain.... Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and
filled my belly with the north wind. And,&#8221; he added hoarsely,
&#8220;to-night I sup with the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping
them in his big kind hands, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Blotte; you&#8217;ve got to sup with <i>us</i> to-night&mdash;gods
are a large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great
room. He turned gloomily:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with
the gods to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs.
&#8220;Chuck it, Blotte&mdash;you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker....
Lor!&#8221; he yawned, &#8220;this is precious slow.&#8221; He
yawned again: &#8220;Paul Pangbutt&#8217;s a confounded long time, ain&#8217;t
he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up
and down the room as before: &#8220;No more Italian waiters for me&mdash;with
curs√®d oily locks,&#8221; he cried&mdash;&#8220;no more grease-spots on
dingy grey tablecloths that hide their offences under smiling
napkins!... To-night I shall be waited upon by the gods....
Never again the boiled potato; never again the homely bun,
damn them!... This is the night of life&mdash;a night for music and
gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it, Blotte. Aren&#8217;t you well, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives
to-night. And I go off&mdash;to sup with the gods.... The world
has forgotten Andrew Blotte.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, boys,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;as it&#8217;s to be a unique night, and
Blotte about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the
morning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he growled&mdash;&#8220;I shall be in the papers to-morrow.
Have no fear of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley slapped him on the shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we ought to give Pangbutt&#8217;s house an air.
There is a lack of the grand manner here. One man-servant is
ridiculously inadequate. At least three of us ought to assist to
wait on the guests. Doome and Fluffy and I and&mdash;and you,
Blotte&mdash;would make a ripping lot of waiters, and it wouldn&#8217;t be
half so slow as talking art and rot to people who don&#8217;t know....
Genius shall serve the mob. This night must never be forgotten.
By Macready, yes&mdash;Pangbutt used to play at play-acting! But
where are his properties?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte was striding the room; he laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay&mdash;the gala-night of life should be gay and joyous,&#8221;
cried he&mdash;&#8220;all the candles lit, as for a bridal.&#8221; He came to a halt,
scowled at the dark hollow of the great doorway, and strode
thither.</p>

<p>The old butler was lurking suspiciously outside.</p>

<p>Blotte grabbed him by his coat lapel, and drew him into the
light:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hireling fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;bring more lights. This place is
like a damned omnibus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old butler held out an expostulant palm in dignified remonstrance:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, gentlemen&mdash;the guests will be arriving in a few
minutes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley went up to him, and gripping his fingers in the old
servant&#8217;s waistcoat, pulled him into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like an unfrocked bishop, Dukes&mdash;it&#8217;s most irreligious,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Look here&#8221;&mdash;he slapped the old man&#8217;s
chest jocosely&mdash;&#8220;your master and the amateur aristocracy used
to have private theatricals here. Where are his wigs and make-up
things? Where does he keep them? Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old butler promptly began to retire backwards upon a
handsome cabinet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, gentlemen; surely I have no need to remind you
that Mr. Pangbutt&#8217;s wigs are his private property,&#8221; said the
shocked, anxious old man. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t Mr. Pangbutt&#8217;s permission&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley followed him up, grimly smiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out, you old panjandrum!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve shown
the hiding-place, you naughty old deceiver. Go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed the expostulating old man from the cabinet, and,
throwing open the drawers, proceeded to ransack them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he cried&mdash;&#8220;splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck a match:</p>

<p>&#8220;Spirit lamp&mdash;everything. Ginger! Here&#8217;s a glorious short
beard affair that goes down the middle of the chin and all along
the throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put it on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>&#8220;By Clarkson, makes me look like a ducal butler&mdash;I&#8217;ll be
butler.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung off his coat, and his deft fingers began to fix the disguise
on his chin.</p>

<p>The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified
despair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;this is not decent. I repeat&mdash;it is not
honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go hon!&#8221; said Rippley, punching the old man in the ribs
with his elbow, and working away at the fixing of his throat-beard.
&#8220;Look here, Fluffy,&#8221; he called hurriedly&mdash;&#8220;you and
Doome <i>must</i> run this pompous old dolt downstairs and shoot him
into the cellar&mdash;and lock him in. Quick! or the people will be
arriving.... I hear carriage-wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robbins and Doome seized the shocked old man and hurried
his protesting stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his
disguise as he went:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boys,&#8221; he called down in a hoarse whisper&mdash;&#8220;if
the old fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until
we release him you needn&#8217;t put him in the cellar.... What?...
Eh?... He says he surrenders? That&#8217;s all right then.
Now back with you&mdash;quick! or the guests will be here&mdash;or Pangbutt
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a loud ring at the door-bell.</p>

<p>Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he
ran to Andrew Blotte:</p>

<p>&#8220;Blotte, old boy,&#8221; said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy
man&#8217;s head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his
pale face&mdash;&#8220;you must look after the cloak-room and change the
tickets and mix the hats.... Ha-ha!&#8221; He laughed mock-tragically.
&#8220;This night must never be forgotten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It never will,&#8221; said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding
again in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Fluffy,&#8221; said Rippley, &#8220;quick, man! put on this
yellow wig, and comb it well over your eyes. There isn&#8217;t a
moment to be lost; Doome, here&#8217;s a black moustache and a
greyish wig&mdash;this is the way to stick it on&mdash;see? Splendid!
Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black
wig which he pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of
France:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boys, I&#8217;m head-waiter, see! And when I bow,
you bow: and when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and
don&#8217;t forget the foreign accent&mdash;try to talk English as you used to
talk French.... Doome, you stand at the landing below, and
see that old Dukes don&#8217;t stir a step from the door&mdash;and bawl up
the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play the general ass. I&#8217;ll
stick to the door here.... Are we all right now?... No,
Blotte&#8217;s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered
and halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white
satin dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak
knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in
his hand.</p>

<p>His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering
and aghast.</p>

<p>There was a titter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharles ze Foorst&mdash;risen from ze dead!&#8221; announced Rippley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&#8221;&mdash;the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. &#8220;Rippley
told me it was a&mdash;fancy-dress&mdash;affair,&#8221; he said plaintively. &#8220;And
to come early.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a wild shout of laughter.</p>

<p>Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and
recognising Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley&mdash;he&mdash;he chose my
dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;don&#8217;t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ...
except Aubrey, who thinks that because he looks like an ass no
one will know him.&#8221; He turned to the others: &#8220;I say, boys,&#8221;
he added, chuckling, &#8220;things are beginning to move at last. This
<i>is</i> going to be a unique night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon
the room.</p>

<p>Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He
roused:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the
guests arriving&mdash;all the clever fellows that have made the world
a delight&mdash;and with them come the dear dead companions that
worked with us, and sang with us, and drank with us&mdash;in Paris....
I know them&mdash;they talk such damned bad French.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley went and touched him on the shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Blotte, old boy; you&#8217;re very queer to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
make me feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned
to them all:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I sup with the gods to-night&mdash;and mix the hats&mdash;and
set the table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear
them call.... God bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley stepped to the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said he in a hushed whisper, &#8220;make a line, quick
there, you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door.
Here comes Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old
nobility.... Come along. Blotte&mdash;don&#8217;t look like a broken-down
anarchist in an advanced stage of pip. You must affect the
smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner, expectant of a fee.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>As Blotte&#8217;s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed,
and there stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure
of their host.</p>

<p>Pangbutt halted, perplexed.</p>

<p>He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in
white silks before him&mdash;turned to the solemn countenances of the
four waiters:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in
this house?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Rippley clasped his hands together unctuously, bowed, smiled
a large Italian smile. He advanced a step, and said with a strong
foreign accent, picking his words with slow deliberation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Pangboot&mdash;it has arrive to ze domestic bootler that he is
indispose sudden-ment. I am he&#8217;s friend that he have ask to take
he&#8217;s place, vis my asseestants.... Your house shall have ze
much honour in my hands&mdash;we have the habit to attend ze best
families&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.</p>

<p>Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be going mad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Rippley bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Pangboot&mdash;me and me friends, we speak not very well ze
Engleesh&mdash;but we much understand it well&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221; Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. &#8220;Get to
your business.... Curse it! I wonder what on earth ails
Dukes.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he
hesitated, bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly
burst a bloodvessel as the tragic Blotte&#8217;s moustache fell off. But
Pangbutt had suddenly remembered that he was host; and advancing
into the room he turned to the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, I am late I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to
Ffolliott, a faint smile flickered over his worried face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been
domestic difficulties&mdash;my butler has gone sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guests were arriving fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistair Maupassant Fosse!&#8221; bawled Rippley at the door.</p>

<p>The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and
tripped across to his host.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nickname they have for me,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;a nickname....&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig
on one side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he
was going to sup with the gods; and he was gone.</p>

<p>Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into
the studio.</p>

<p>Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he
heard his thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know&mdash;I feel such an ass&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said he absently&mdash;&#8220;it can&#8217;t be helped. Make
the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I assure you&mdash;they told me it was to be a fancy-dress
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rippley bawled at the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Gilders Cinnamon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Gilders Persimmon shuffled into the room; and Pangbutt
went to meet the old baronet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Persimmon coming to-night, Sir Gilders?&#8221; he shouted
into his ear; the old man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; bawled Pangbutt into his ear; &#8220;Sir Gilders, allow me
to introduce Mr. Fosse, who, I need not tell you, is the well-known
critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is
to appear in a few days&mdash;you must win his favour to your poems.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.</p>

<p>Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes
were upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;my eulogy appears to-morrow.&#8221; He forgot
to bawl.</p>

<p>Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed
his weak hearing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;borrow? Why borrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir Gilders,&#8221; cried Fosse, getting very hot&mdash;&#8220;I did not
say borrow&mdash;I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>

<p>There was a titter....</p>

<p>Ffolliott, thinking he saw someone he knew, went up to Lovegood
and slapped the big man on the back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, old chap!&#8221; cried he.</p>

<p>Blank consternation came upon him as Lovegood slowly turned
and solemnly faced him. The weak-knee&#8217;d, foolish Ffolliott
faltered nervously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, er&mdash;er&mdash;I thought you were someone else,&#8221; he drawled.</p>

<p>Lovegood nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said sepulchrally.</p>

<p>Ffolliott tittered confusedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-yes&mdash;indeed,&#8221; he said, twisting his fingers and fidgeting.
&#8220;D&#8217;you know, I feel such an awful ass&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is no excuse for your being in the other ass&#8217;s skin!&#8221;
he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but don&#8217;t you see&mdash;that&#8217;s just it! They told me it was
a fancy-dress affair....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; bawled Sir Gilders Persimmon.</p>

<p>All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little
man shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was saying,&#8221; shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,
&#8220;that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age
for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old baronet shook his head:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>&#8220;The man who what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse licked his lips sullenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who doesn&#8217;t play whist,&#8221; shrieked Fosse, reddening
miserably.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221; asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lays up a sad old age for himself,&#8221; screamed the miserable
little man.</p>

<p>The old gentleman knit his brows:</p>

<p>&#8220;A reformed rake?&#8221; he asked testily....</p>

<p>But attention was diverted from the fussy little minor critic&#8217;s
despair by the murmur of admiration which greeted the entrance
into the room of a beautiful woman to whom Quogge Myre was
paying aggressively marked court as the announcement of her
name called the regard of the assembled guests to her arrival.
Myre was ever for stealing the lime-light. He was a born filcher
of honour. But the beauty&#8217;s calm dismissal of him, as she swept
towards her host, gave Myre a sudden hysteric desire to talk
loudly and hide his chagrin; and he turned at the sound of
Fosse&#8217;s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal. Fosse
in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the
discussion round about him:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the arts,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;woman does not, cannot, shine.
She only exists&mdash;on sufferance. A woman&#8217;s province&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Myre had strolled towards the voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am flattered to find,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that Mr. Fosse has been
reading me. He is right. A woman&#8217;s province is to be beautiful;
and if she write at all she may write of the nursery&mdash;of the domesticities.
A woman has not the experiences of life&mdash;she writes only
from intuition. She cannot experience the emotions of a man&mdash;cannot
describe all shades of life&mdash;is too careful of her skirts to
have been on the heights and in the gutters&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said he, with big deliberate voice&mdash;&#8220;never shall I
again approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman,&#8221; said he, &#8220;cannot be in the thrash and fume of
life. She only peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the
doings of the world. She has not physical strength&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tra-la-lee!&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;opera&mdash;bouffe&mdash;bouffe&mdash;bouffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myre went suddenly dumb....</p>

<p>Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was
wetting his lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre&#8217;s yawing
should give opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man,
the deaf old gentleman asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir Gilders&mdash;I said that the man who does not play whist
is laying up a sad old age&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes&mdash;very likely&mdash;very
likely. But it&#8217;s dangerous doctrine&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>&#8220;No, Sir Gilders,&#8221; shrieked the perspiring little man&mdash;&#8220;I say
the man who does not play <i>whist</i>.&#8221; He coughed&mdash;his voice
breaking. &#8220;Oh, damn this old gentleman!&#8221; he added, moving
irritably away from him....</p>

<p>Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don&#8217;t say that this Anthony
Bickersteth is a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature.
How can you define these things? It is there, or it is not there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse skipped up to the group:</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>I</i> say&mdash;what <i>I</i> say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a
sneer played about his puffy lip&mdash;became too tense for silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;This man repeats what I say&mdash;what I <i>used</i> to say&mdash;like
flattery,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Lovegood smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;<i>he</i> stays in Paris sometimes now. And there
are the French newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myre shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have changed all my ideas on these subjects&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to
the group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge
Myre, he said with affected drawl:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, I feel such an awful ass&mdash;and I don&#8217;t get used
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young fellow,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you must not be egotistical&mdash;it&#8217;s
bad for the morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; drawled Ffolliott miserably&mdash;&#8220;I am quite angry
with Rippley&mdash;he told me it was a fancy-dress affair&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse turned his back upon him impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;and I have a signed article in <i>The Discriminator</i>
to prove it&mdash;a genius has arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Pegasus?&#8221; sneered Aubrey, raising ironic eyebrows.</p>

<p>Lovegood laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;by omnibus,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Let us all be winged asses to-night.
Fosse has not secured a government monopoly.&#8221;...</p>

<p>From the great doorway:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistair and Mrs. Nezzerbie Gomme!&#8221; announced Rippley;
and as the pair were greeted by all near them, Rippley stepped to
the head of the great stairs, and going up to a pompous man
as that worthy set foot on the topmost step, he said to him confidentially:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and
telling the fellar with the red hair that I want him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh&mdash;pooh!&#8221; said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poof&mdash;poof!&#8221; said Rippley. &#8220;Giddy old thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced over the balustrade down to the next landing, and
caught Doome&#8217;s eye:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beelzebub!&#8221; he growled&mdash;&#8220;the whole town&#8217;s coming to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
silly theatrical affair.... I say, we ought to go and see that
Andrew Blotte&#8217;s mixing the hats thoroughly. Hullo! There&#8217;s
Anthony Baddlesmere just arrived. Wait, I&#8217;ll come down. I
want to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir
Tankerton Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man
mincingly, and said affectedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton&mdash;d&#8217;you know, I feel such an awful
ass&mdash;but they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity
at the thing before him, sniffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; he said testily.</p>

<p>Ffolliott went away.</p>

<p>As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway,
an absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his
elbow, followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of
withered prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve
inquiringly, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My good man&mdash;before you announce our names, will you tell
me which is the host? I have never seen my host before&mdash;in
fact&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poof&mdash;poof!&#8221; squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; The little old gentleman turned to his little old
lady; and added in a confidential undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;A most extraordinary person&mdash;a most extraordinary <i>house</i>!...
But I have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a
strange country.... In fact, Charlotte, it&#8217;s <i>rather</i> thrilling, is
it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little withered lady, all pleased excitement, said: &#8220;<i>Quite</i>
thrilling, James!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt seeing awkwardness at the door, and missing the loud
announcement of names, went a few paces closer to it to meet his
newly-arrived guests.</p>

<p>The little old gentleman entered the room vaguely, the dandruff
of the philosophic habit upon his coat-collar, and his wig full of
reasons&mdash;very markedly a professor. He had the air of cataloguing
ideas. The little old lady, a couple of paces behind him,
followed him.</p>

<p>Pangbutt exchanged greetings with him.</p>

<p>Said the professor:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, sir; my sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s brother-in-law, Sir
Gilders Persimmon, was good enough to say that you would allow
me to meet Mr. Anthony Bickersteth here.... I am writing a
work to disprove the insanity of genius.... It is a part of my
theory that the human personality cannot be hidden by artifice&mdash;that
the strong temperament shows itself in the vigorous growth
of the hair&mdash;and so on.... I am, sir, I may have forgotten to
say, Professor Curtis.... I am an inveterate novel-reader....
My wife keeps a diary.... Where are you, Charlotte?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Ah, yes. But, fervently as I admire Mr. Bickersteth&#8217;s prose, I
should like to suggest to him that in his next work he might make
more of that unworked mine, the folk-lore of the London coster&mdash;or
greengrocer.... I am most anxious that Mr. Bickersteth
should be a virile person whose moustache springs out strongly
from under the nostrils, with a tendency towards ruddiness in the
colouring.... But I fear that on this&mdash;what I may call his&mdash;er,&#8221;
he tittered&mdash;&#8220;his unveiling, I am too thrilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kept button-holing Pangbutt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Too thrilled to&mdash;er&mdash;I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed
is Charlotte&mdash;oh, ah, yes&mdash;Charlotte!&#8221; He searched about
behind him for the little old lady, who moved up to his side.
&#8220;Oh, ah, yes&mdash;there you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce
Mr. Pangbutt, our host. May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth
has yet arrived? No?... How fortunate! How very
fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt led them to chairs.</p>

<p>Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as
is concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and
one, taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident
that passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning,
swept the room with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How amusin&#8217;! how absolutely amusin&#8217;!&#8221; she crooned. &#8220;I
like literary and artistic people <i>so</i> much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;they are <i>so</i> different to one&#8217;s own class....
And actresses <i>dress</i> so well!&#8221;</p>

<p>She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something
to the lady of the lorgnettes.</p>

<p>The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said she</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m!&mdash;yes. Pills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pangbutt&#8217;s father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m! Yes. I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;d&#8217;you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>She whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Persimmon? Indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered
eyes expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh.
The lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the
assembled guests critically through the glasses:</p>

<p>&#8220;I absolutely <i>adore</i> literary people&mdash;and artists&mdash;and actors&mdash;and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all
slept in attics. And really, it&#8217;s quite the <i>fashion</i> to go on the
stage now.... Who&#8217;s the fright in the post-office red?...
Oh! is it?... Lady Margaret&#8217;s son has gone on the stage....
Gerty, do you know who that dark creature is? with the
Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the young fellow is
getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have a gentleman
on the stage&mdash;besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly manner&mdash;quite
unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
manager is rather exclusive&mdash;he called the company together the
other day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise
him in the street. It&#8217;s so nice for the young fellow to be with such
a <i>gentleman</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Our gardener&#8217;s son has joined a circus too. Such an
amusin&#8217; boy, he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It brings it all so home to one, doesn&#8217;t it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it, indeed! But I confess I have always been fascinated
by the stage. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; so very romantic about
livin&#8217; in green-rooms and paintin&#8217; your face, and&mdash;pretendin&#8217; to
be someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>The lorgnettes were flicked open again, and glittered upon Sir
Gilders Persimmon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! But he is so very old&mdash;and she&mdash;but there is such
a difference of social rank between a baronet&#8217;s wife and a mere
painter&mdash;surely! Still, he <i>is</i> very old. Almost permissible sin,
Gerty.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both tittered.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;you are really quite naughty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Gilders pounced upon Fosse, whom he had followed round
the room, put up a hand to aid his dull hearing, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of dotage&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse winced uneasily:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he shrieked&mdash;&#8220;I was <i>not</i> talking of dotage. I say
that the man who does not play whist lays up a sad old age for
himself.&#8221; And, turning on his heel impatiently, &#8220;The devil take
the man!&#8221; said he, and walked away.</p>

<p>Ffolliott espying the two newly-arrived ladies across the room,
made his way to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Miss Foljambe Pfinch,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I feel such
an ass; they told me it was a&mdash;fancy&mdash;dress&mdash;affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lorgnettes were turned upon him:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that ridiculous Mr. Ffolliott,&#8221; said she; and laughed
immoderately.</p>

<p>Ffolliott sighed, and turned away:</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody seems to think I am an ass to-night,&#8221; he said
wearily. &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Fosse. I don&#8217;t like Fosse&mdash;but I&#8217;ll talk
to <i>him</i>. No&mdash;he&#8217;s talking to another man. I think I&#8217;ll go home.
No, I won&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every fellow does something idiotic in his life,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He watched Fosse button-hole Gomme; and he saw Gomme&#8217;s
lips smile amusedly as he gazed at the floor, listening to him.</p>

<p>He bent all his attention to hear what passed between the
two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you know, Mr. Gomme,&#8221; said the fussy little man&mdash;&#8220;in
confidence, all these fellows take themselves too seriously to-day.
Look at Rippley! he&#8217;s utterly uncultured&mdash;he hasn&#8217;t an aitch in
his composition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme nodded:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t an aitch in composition,&#8221; he said demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no.&#8221; Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. &#8220;But he
can&#8217;t even pronounce the names of the ancients whose gods he
models!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but he can model &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse was puzzled for an answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8217;yes, that&#8217;s true perhaps. But there&#8217;s Aubrey&mdash;look at his
legs, his knees, his hair, his airs, his ties! He is for ever publishing
volumes of poems which no one reads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gomme. &#8220;But the publishers must have their
luxuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is Blotte. You know he has never produced a
complete work yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. But supposing one day he writes lines that, like some
of his handsome acts, shall never fade!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you think that!&#8221; said Fosse, licking his lips. &#8220;Well
now, there&#8217;s Lovegood. You know, he never says a really exquisite
thing&mdash;he is always ponderous&mdash;and rather obvious. He
has not made his mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing he has done acts that will live in the memory of his
friends, Mr. Fosse! And&mdash;perhaps&mdash;when he has been dead a
hundred years&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;you really think so.&#8221; The foxy little eyes of Mr.
Fosse were searching the humorist&#8217;s features keenly.</p>

<p>Netherby Gomme took Fosse&#8217;s arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Mr. Fosse, there&#8217;s this Netherby Gomme, the over-rated
rogue,&#8221; said he, with a whimsical twinkle in the eyes; &#8220;you
know, he never really says a humorous thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;But he can write them,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Gomme laughed, and gripping the little man&#8217;s thin shoulder,
said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fosse, you are sometimes inspired.... You are inspired
to-night.... I have never known you so inspired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosse smirked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway,&#8221; he said&mdash;and he grew taller as he said it&mdash;&#8220;I
think that to-morrow I shall have convinced many that, to
create a masterpiece, requires a man&#8217;s powers and a man&#8217;s wit
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Anthony Bickersteth!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old butler stood at the door and sang out the name, making
the announcement in a loud clear voice.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon the assembled guests. There was a
craning towards the great open doors.</p>

<p>A rustle of silk, and Caroline Baddlesmere stepped into their
sight.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a hoarse utterance from Fosse:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said he; and was dumb.</p>

<p>There was a loud shout from the bohemians, who rushed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
greet Caroline; but the smile that had flickered about her lips
went out.</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere had entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caroline,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;quick, for God&#8217;s sake, where is Paul?&#8221;</p>

<p>She signed towards him where he stood near at hand by the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kate Ormsby has been found&mdash;it&#8217;s too horrible,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He glanced round the room, and hurriedly made for his host:</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; he said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;get rid of these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt raised surprised eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get rid?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere made an impatient gesture:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them they must go. Send them down to supper&mdash;no,
he&#8217;s lying on the supper table. Let the butler tell them there&#8217;s
death in the house&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything, Paul&mdash;get rid of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s eyes were a blank bewildered surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony touched his arm:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Paul&mdash;give the order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt wet his dogged lips sullenly.</p>

<p>Anthony took hold of his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew Blotte has hanged himself in your cellars. I was just
too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s voice was a shadow of a whisper. The floor swung
up to strike him&mdash;swung away from his feet so that he nearly fell.
He reeled a step, and sank into the gilt armchair that was the
splendid seat for his painting-throne.</p>

<p>The whisper spread; and the guests stole quietly from the
place.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXXXIX</h3></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>Wherein Andrew Blotte draws aside the Arras that hangs Across
the Unknown and joins the Company at a Larger Banquet</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> left their host alone with Anthony Baddlesmere.</p>

<p>The wretched man, sunk in a dazed huddle in the midst of
his splendid home, sat crouched in the gilt chair, bewildered, as
one struck down by a sudden blow. Slowly his wits came back
and traced a miserable picture of bygone fatuities and a black
knavery into the elaborate design of the rich carpet at his feet.</p>

<p>His lips moved with guttural complaint:</p>

<p>&#8220;God! what an awakening! what an awakening!... What
strange destiny arranges it all?... The coming of this thing
has haunted me for nights.... There seems to come into
our lives a day when we awake of a sudden from the aimless
inconsequences of years&mdash;to the aimlessness. But&mdash;God! what
an awakening!&#8221;</p>

<p>Anthony Baddlesmere went to him and laid a gentle hand
on his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something to have awakened, Paul.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The miserable man, his face between
his hands, thus crouching there, elbows on knees, gazed at the
strange things that wove themselves into the pattern at his feet.</p>

<p>He roused again:</p>

<p>&#8220;There will always be this dead man in my house,&#8221; he said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Baddlesmere sighed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear it,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Paul Pangbutt was silent for awhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; he said at last&mdash;&#8220;why did the man do this
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He put his bed in pawn three days ago&mdash;for the little singing
woman&mdash;Kate Ormsby. But she has utterly gone under&mdash;since&mdash;Paris.&#8221;
He hesitated.... &#8220;I found her this morning....
He was with her.... She had taken her life with her own
hand, at daybreak. You remember how she used to air her
pathetic little ambitions about Fame and Name! Well, Death
has fanned up her little flame of Notoriety for nine days at last.
Her name will be in large letters on all the newspaper bills to-night.
And&#8221;&mdash;he smiled sadly&mdash;&#8220;she will not see it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>&#8220;But why did he do this thing, man?&#8221; The miserable voice
was a dry-throated whisper. &#8220;Why did he do&mdash;this&mdash;awful&mdash;thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been starving&mdash;starving&mdash;for days. He had
promised to come to me if he needed help.... His pockets
were empty&mdash;except for pawnbrokers&#8217; tickets&mdash;he had even
hired his clothes for to-night. I came away as&mdash;they&mdash;were&mdash;searching
him&mdash;downstairs&mdash;on the supper-table.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other sat brooding for awhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have helped&mdash;I did not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Paul&mdash;we <i>could</i> have helped&mdash;we <i>ought</i> to have known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt buried his face in his hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is horrible,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; said Baddlesmere&mdash;&#8220;I had better go and see what is
being done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>The old butler hobbled into the room, as Baddlesmere went
out. He carried a letter on a silver salver:</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter, sir, was found in Mr. Blotte&#8217;s breast-pocket,&#8221; he
said, standing beside the crouching figure of his master.</p>

<p>He coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is addressed to you, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Pangbutt did not move.</p>

<p>The old servant coughed again:</p>

<p>&#8220;And, beg pardon, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt made a gesture of impatience:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Dukes,&#8221; he said wearily, &#8220;give me the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put out his hand and took it from the salver, dazedly. He
tore open the cover, listlessly. As he unfolded the sheet of
paper, a bundle of dingy pawnbrokers&#8217; tickets fell out of a piece
of paper that fluttered to the floor. The old butler stooped
stiffly, and handed them to him.</p>

<p>Pangbutt read:</p>





<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Paul Pangbutt</span>,</p>

<p>I am claiming your hospitality to-night&mdash;indeed, I have
nowhere else to go. It is the last night of my winter&mdash;the last
hour of my insignificance. To-morrow I shall have drifted into
fame on the tide of a passing scandal. My last poem will have a
fictitious money-value out of all proportion to its intrinsic literary
merits. Here you have it&mdash;my trust to you.</p>

<p>It is a crude rattle-pot affair enough, but the ink is near
done; the rhymes jostle each other, for my last candle is burnt
low; and, like school-girls and professors of letters, your editor
has the delusion, like them that make laws for our art and decide
as to our magnificence, that rhymes are the essentials of the
poetic. Therefore, so that it may pass for poetry, I have flung
you a rhyme or so&mdash;literature to come to birth in these days
must satisfy the newspaper offices.</p>

<p>Take this, then, to one of these procurers of letters, and
offer it for sale. Let him bid high, remembering the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the scandal; and, with the monies, I charge you redeem my
pledges and distribute my few personal knick-knacks where they
shall cease to be scored with the scratchings of pawnbrokers,
amongst my dear old friends&mdash;for, God granted me that splendid
largess, spite of all my sins.</p>

<p>There will fall a tear for Andrew Blotte; but there will be
more of shrugging of respectable shoulders.</p>

<p>To-morrow will whisper that I was mad.</p>

<p>Tush! what is madness? To half the world, madness is
but the rejection of the commonplace. The sanest sit in the
centre of the whirligig of life, self-satisfied with their sanity and
hugging it, but if they wait long enough, even to them old age
will bring prattling wits, and the giggle of foolishness. The
bee in the bonnet is an affair of a few years. Who shall escape
the passing delirium, wrap he his grey habit about him ever so
closely and sit he ever so still for fear of coming to light-headedness
by walking amongst the heights and taking the risks of
great adventure? We must needs wear the straws in our hair,
even though it be in some corner, furtively, hoping others think
us wise&mdash;if we but wait long enough. I&#8217;m for your summer
madness&mdash;and to-night I go to make revel with the gods.</p>

<p>What more mad than to live alone! how worse than mad
to have wrought loneliness to others! What more cracked-brained
dolt than he who grinds to dust his grubbing years,
thinking to find happiness in large figures of gold when his hair
is grown grey within the four walls of a counting-house&mdash;whilst
slip past him, unknown, unfelt, with the clock&#8217;s every tick, the
little joys that build a splendid experience. They that grub for
wealth as an end are like mad hogs that bury their eyes in
noisome swill, unsuspecting that life is a glorious pageant, and
goes by.</p>

<p>Mad? Who so mad as they who rush through their years to
vague ends and sordid aims? These flip through the pages of the
book of life, missing the sweetness of its wide romance, that they
may but know the end of the tale. And whither leads this
frantic skipping? To old age, and withering, and decay, and
the grave.</p>

<p>Tush! Life&#8217;s a Jest. Even Unconscious Humour grinds the
Unconscious Joke. We make a fuss of all we do, though it end in
Smoke.... A little skip upon this little earth, maybe in tinsel
of the Great&mdash;the years skip also, and we find ourselves without
Heaven&#8217;s Gate, naked of all we had, save the Habit of Kind Things
we did and Spoke.</p>

<p>Philosophy, with critic eyes, examines our Emotions; his
sight grows dim, his heart runs dry, in analyzing Notions; his
brains are sear with brow-knit peer at Things that Do Not Matter&mdash;of
a sudden he learns that Acts are Life, Theories but Ink or
Chatter; he awakes to find Life is left behind, his eyes Lone Age
in the Mirror meet&mdash;the Old Man with the Scythe goes by and
sweeps him from his feet.</p>

<p>Why burn the Fire of life to questionable Idols? or seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the useless things we may not know? Religion is not in our
solemn Goings to Church, but in the sweet things that we do
between, in these our little wanderings to and fro&mdash;the giving
of a part of our success, a tithe or so, to help our fellows with a
hand unseen. Therefore, so let us live that whilst we live
we each the other profit, and walk our little moment in nice
ways, and talk not of it.</p>

<p>How pompous are we in the contemplation of our little
selves! The narrow vision of each one of us sees in the broad
fertile world but the carpet for our individual feet. But, hist!
in the middle of our strut a something snaps&mdash;we pass, with
scarce a sigh, into an eternal mystery.... So it comes that a
still white figure lies a-bed, for once in some becoming stiffness
of the thing called dignity&mdash;and in the room and all about, they
that walk, walk hushedly, sobbing that one is dead. And for a
night they weep. But at the daybreak of the morrow the
mourners, wearied with weeping, raise half-forgetting eyes
window-wards, and peep out through the streak of daylight by
the blind, where poised in swinging skies the exultant lark hails
the gladdening sun that comes on swift obliterating feet to paint
with gaudy colours a new world. So they that weep arise, and
sigh, and dry their eyes, and bury their dead; and, the dear
dead departed, draw their blinds&mdash;and lo! in the garden where
we laughed in pleasant toil, another digs and delves.</p>

<p>The paper fluttered and fell from Pangbutt&#8217;s fingers.</p>

<p>The old man-servant coughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ope, sir, that I did right; but I gave the two models, that
got here first with the good news, a sovereign apiece. Mr. Rippley
he said it was a dead-heat between them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sovereigns? models?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt&#8217;s brows contracted painfully:</p>

<p>The old man servant started at the hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;it&#8217;s election night, sir&mdash;at the Royal Academy, sir.
And Mr. Rippley has been elected for sculpture, and yourself for
painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pangbutt burst into a horrible fit of loud laughter, and shook
his head, and laughed and laughed again.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at the old servant; and again he burst
into his horrible laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gord!&#8221; said the old butler.</p>

<p>The old man, looking down upon the huddled figure that
laughed, saw that his wits had snapped.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein Hereditary Greatness fails to Glitter Hidalgic</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Mr. Sim Crittenden, the music-hall star, the adored comedian
of London&#8217;s masses, what remained of the old prize-fighting ostler
of Burford was severely disguised under the pose of the baritone
god&mdash;the maker of the horse-laugh of the multitude. But to the
credit of the tailor, be it said, it was impossible to cover all sign
of the huge shoulders, the great chest; and the gloves he wore
only exaggerated the weight of the hard-hitting hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Sim Crittenden, arrayed in an elaborately loud attempt to
be strikingly quiet in hue, and aspiring to the latest severity of
mode, to catch as it were the careful carelessness of the young
blood at the seaside, sat on a bench on Hampstead Heath beside
the light and befrilled figure of Miss Polly Whiffles, temporarily
Ffolliott; she drew patterns of embarrassment in the gravel
whilst he held her in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Polly,&#8221; said Sim Crittenden&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m a rough
man.... I know you are a lady and ought to marry a curate,
and I&#8217;m no account, and all that. But I think I can get it to you
if you&#8217;ll be patient.... I&#8217;m on the music-halls, I&#8217;m makin&#8217;
eighty gold pieces every week. It&#8217;s no good being modest about
it, and I&#8217;m not&mdash;that&#8217;s God&#8217;s truth put into the naked vernacular.
It may sound vulgar, but it&#8217;s so.... Now, ye know, I don&#8217;t
know what to do with it&mdash;that&#8217;s the fact. I could buy fancy
rabbits or a talkin&#8217; canary and all that&mdash;or I could chuck it about
on the turf at race-meetin&#8217;s&mdash;but unfortunately God did not make
me in the image of a jackass, and I&#8217;m not going against the works
of God. I&#8217;m modest.... I could start a girl and a brougham,
but I&#8217;m tired of prize-fighting.... Now, what I say is this: if
I had your dainty little person a-sittin&#8217; at the end of my table
every day, it might make me look less of a blamey athlete and
more of a man of fashion, see! Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>Mr. Sim Crittenden touched her arm anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, Whiffles isn&#8217;t much of a name; no woman could be
called Whiffles and remain virtuous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sim&mdash;you don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;ve sat as a model.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to be blamed for falling in love with a good figure,
am I?&#8221; said Mr. Sim Crittenden laconically.</p>

<p>She smiled away a tear:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the boy,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;my Ponsonby has no father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Sim Crittenden pushed his hat back on his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all tommy nonsense,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If I ain&#8217;t strong
enough to be his father, good God, what&#8217;s the use of giving me
eighty pounds a week, eh?... What?... Born out o&#8217;
wedlock? Blame me, so was I.... Now, come&mdash;drop this
nonsense; let me hug you well&mdash;though it is a blamed nervous
job with me always&mdash;you&#8217;re as delicate as a confounded caramel&mdash;though
I must say I like it when I get there&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that as the Honourable Rupert Greppel,
strolling hidalgic beside his nervous little aristocratic friend,
Lord Monty Askew, took a short cut down a dirty side-alley off
Booksellers&#8217; Row&mdash;Monty complaining the while that they should
have allowed the smells of so unusual a proceeding to come between
them and their nobility&mdash;Mr. Sim Crittenden came down the other
end of the same high-smelling by-way, his pretty Polly at his side,
with intent to get her some dinner at a restaurant he knew of,
before the dusk grew to darkness and he had to answer his call &#8220;to
play the giddy goat for a consideration&#8221; at one of those places
called music-halls.</p>

<p>There were but few of its dirty inhabitants in the dirty street,
when Rupert Greppel took the wall of the pretty lady and her
escort on the narrow footway and put her out into the dirty gutter
of the dirtier street; but when Sim Crittenden, having dropped
behind the girl, following her to let the others pass the more easily,
put himself before the great man, and Rupert Greppel cried &#8220;Out
of the way, fellow!&#8221; and Sim Crittenden mocked him, the street
began to fill.</p>

<p>It was a deadlock.</p>

<p>Mr. Sim Crittenden took off his hat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;I am in the illegitimate drama, wherein to
bray like an ass is the soul of comedy. I am a student of bad
manners. Would you mind doing it again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel struck him with his cane.</p>

<p>Sim Crittenden hit him violently in the mouth, so that Rupert
fell; and as Rupert gathered himself and his dazed wits together,
Sim Crittenden took off his straw hat and his coat and handed
them sadly to Polly, and, expressing his muttered regret that he
was making a beastly scene and was to baptize his betrothal in
claret, he squared his huge shoulders for the fray.</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel arose and made an ugly rush at him, and after
some fencing, to allow of the crowd&#8217;s whimsical twitting of the
big man, Sim Crittenden gripped his lips tight and struck out,
hitting the hidalgic Rupert heavily on the jaw. Rupert answered
the helm and sat down&mdash;violently.</p>

<p>Sim Crittenden stooped over him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, guv&#8217;nor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this ain&#8217;t no match. It&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
comedy scene for me, but it&#8217;s a nasty chunk of tragedy for you.
You&#8217;d better go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rupert Greppel slowly rose, his face was very pale, and, pulling
himself together, he went pell-mell, legs and arms, at the past-master
of the craft; and Sim Crittenden, seeing he was beyond
argument, punished him severely, then held him off with a couple
of buffets in the face, and struck him over the heart with a blow
that would have cracked a door.</p>

<p>Rupert&#8217;s heels clattered on the pavement, and he again sat
down heavily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take yer seats for Westminister Abbey,&#8221; said a wag; and
there was laughter.</p>

<p>Lord Montagu Askew now complained that Mr. Crittenden&#8217;s
acts were illegal and in bad taste.</p>

<p>Sim Crittenden walked up to the dandified figure of Monty
Askew and gave him a sounding slap on the side of the head that
knocked his silk hat into the gutter.</p>

<p>Monty went and picked up his hat amidst peals of laughter,
and, holding out one expostulant gloved hand, he wiped his
bleeding nose on a fine cambric handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a most vulgar fellow,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;a most vulgar
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd cooed with merriment.</p>

<p>Crittenden went up to him and slapped his face with great
strong hands.</p>

<p>Monty Askew sat down on a doorstep and wept bitterly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The injustice of it!&#8221; he sobbed&mdash;&#8220;the injustice of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Montagu Askew, blaming the high gods. Thus, as always,
dragging the innocent into his quarrels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Sim Crittenden walked into the lamp-lit dusk with Polly, he
said, punching the palm of his left with the great fist of the right:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy, Polly, old girl&mdash;I have been dying to hit something
all this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein the Heir of the Ffolliotts falls the Victim to a Limited
Badinage</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the First-Night of an historic Shakespeare revival; and
the theatre of the Lyceum was emptying its fashionable crowd of
richly dressed women and men into the garrulous murk of the
noisy night. The upturned faces of the gaping crowd, that stood
along the great portico in the yellow haze of the street, gazed with
serious admiration at the glowing splendour that enveloped the
fashionable and the rich&mdash;the solemn intentness of their unspoken
admiration rippling now and again into a good-natured grin upon
some street-wag&#8217;s sally at the wrinkles of a lean dowager or the
comic aspect of an over-plump matron or plain daughter or inane
youth or the dozen and one whimsical aspects of things that catch
the rambling humour of the people.</p>

<p>Across their gaze swept out of the bawling tumult of the night
sundry wreaths of fog, torn from the mists that rose from the
river hard by.</p>

<p>On the steps, under the classic portals, stood Ponsonby Wattles
Ffolliott, with Quogge Myre and another; and, blowing the cigarette
smoke through his nose, where he stood magnificent above
the people, Ffolliott was in a stream of languid babble upon the
strange fancy that took people to sit through the gloom of a tragedy
at considerable personal discomfort and expense &#8220;sitting in a dull
hole of a place, watching people pretendin&#8217; to be dead and that
sort of rot,&#8221; when gayer wits were being fascinated by the movements
of women&#8217;s legs in a good break-down at a musical comedy,
or &#8220;havin&#8217; a good hearty laugh&#8221; at the comicalities of the latest
comic craze at the music-halls. Thus P. W. Ffolliott&mdash;when his
eyes were caught by the bold inviting eyes of a handsome young
woman that passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damned pretty woman!&#8221; he drawled&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m off. Ta-ta,
Myre! I suppose you&#8217;ll want me to meet you at that other dead-house
to-morrow, eh? All right. I&#8217;ll be there. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved a gay salute, and was gone, disappearing into the
bustling throng of the street.</p>

<p>The girl pretended to hurry, but Ffolliott, elbowing his way
through the moving crowd, soon overtook her. She was pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
to be seen with a gentleman of fashion. She was also a little
frightened at the insistence of his admiration.</p>

<p>She lifted her skirts above her ankles and picked her way
daintily across the Strand, through the riot of passing vehicles
and bawling cads, walking serenely amidst the roar of the bewildering
traffic.</p>

<p>He kept by her side.</p>

<p>She reached the pavement, and turned towards Charing Cross.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jove,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you are a stunning pretty girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know&#8221;&mdash;she spoke with a marked cockney accent
that strangely sullied the handsome red lips&mdash;&#8220;my looking-glass
tells me that&mdash;more than once a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;ha, yes; of course,&#8221; he drawled, gazing at her admiringly&mdash;&#8220;of
course it does. How stupid of me&mdash;how immaculately
stupid! But we had better get into a hansom and have
some supper somewhere, eh! Rather strenuous idea that&mdash;eh!&#8221;
He haw-hawed.</p>

<p>She laughed, tossed her head&mdash;stopped abruptly. And he,
looking at her, saw that her face was deathly white. She grasped
his arm suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down here,&#8221; she said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned into the foggy blackness of a dingy street that
descended to the river, walking hurriedly&mdash;and he, expostulant,
followed her:</p>

<p>&#8220;By George&mdash;a very pretty figure,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But look here,&#8221;
he added plaintively, &#8220;where are we going?... It&#8217;s getting so
damned foggy I shall lose you if you hurry so, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came to a halt under a dingy gas-lamp, and faced him; and
he saw that she was very beautiful. The colour had left her face.
She was white as marble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a man&mdash;I was once engaged to him&mdash;see?&#8221; she said....
&#8220;He is a dangerous man. Wait here a bit&mdash;he&#8217;ll miss us in
the fog.... My Gord!&#8221; she added hoarsely, &#8220;he has followed
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great wreaths of mist swept by them and filled the black
hollows of the narrow way with yellow smoke; and into the
sombre gleam of the lamp-light, from out the black murk, came
the pallid faces of three dark figures&mdash;rough-looking fellows that
strode down upon them.</p>

<p>One, more genial than the others, cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Chi-hike! that you, Em&#8217;ly?&#8221;</p>

<p>They halted before the lamp-post.</p>

<p>The girl stood rigid; and faced the three men with contempt.</p>

<p>The wag of the party grinned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Engaged, Em&#8217;ly?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>He was set aside by an evil-looking ruffian:</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, Em&#8217;ly; two years has made a lady of you&mdash;don&#8217;t
you make any mistake about it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>She, handsome in her sudden dignity, stood facing the men
calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t chi-hiked by cab-runners,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and I ain&#8217;t
Emily&mdash;except to my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed roughly. He jerked a thumb at Ffolliott:</p>

<p>&#8220;This&mdash;one of your friends?&#8221; he asked with a sneering raw
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;you leave him alone&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuss?&#8221; he jeered, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put my bonnet-pin in your face,&#8221; she said calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make your friendship pretty prompt, Em&#8217;ly,&#8221; said he;
and added with a mirthless laugh: &#8220;I saw your bleery aristocrat
follow you from the bleery the-ayter&mdash;I saw the whole bleery
scandal. Yer see, I&#8217;ve been sleepin&#8217; out under the blue a night
or two, and lookin&#8217; slippy for a light job, so I have my two eyes
about me when I fall up against a the-ayter door at closin&#8217; time
and the audience is a-gettin&#8217; the chuck-out. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl put her hand before her mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me yawnin&#8217;,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you make me sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to sleep too much to-night,&#8221; he said, scowling
upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where I come in,&#8221; she said, carelessly shrugging
her shoulders; and she stooped and gathered up her skirts in her
gloved hand as though to be moving again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yer see,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;it seems to me as you&#8217;re what the
poet bloke calls the Juliet of a Night&mdash;and I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be your
bloomin&#8217; Romeo, see?&#8221;... He stepped nearer to her....
&#8220;Hold up yer bloomin&#8217; mouth, and let&#8217;s kiss yer head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ffolliott put out his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, you vulgar fellow,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was hustled from behind and tripped across the kerb-stone&mdash;threw
up his hands&mdash;lurched forward and fell across the footway.
As he fell he rolled over, showing a white face that gleamed
death-like under the dim light of the gas-lamp. He lay very still.</p>

<p>The girl whimpered, pulled herself together, and fixed her eyes
sternly on the scowling fellow before her, his hands thrust in his
coat pockets:</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you do it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that?&#8221; he asked with a sneer, his chin thrust out
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;When twelve men talk about these kind of accidents,&#8221; she
said with biting precision and level voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard them call
it murder; and the judge&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>The wag of the party, he whom they called Charlie, interfered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Henery,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll be &#8217;ittin&#8217; a bloke harder
nor what yer wish for, one evenin&#8217;, and meetin&#8217; yer Gawd without
a cellar-flap to dance your bloomin&#8217; double-shuffle on, see? The
girl&#8217;s right, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scowling fellow stooped down, emptied the money out of
the pockets of the fallen man, the gold from one trouser pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the silver from the other, and banknotes from the breast-pocket
of the coat. He put back a few shillings in silver, and growled at
one of the others to let the watch be and keep his dirty hands from
messing the toff&#8217;s clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mates,&#8221; said he, &#8220;rub your hands clean on the seats of yer
trouseys, and help me lift the aristocracy on to the road, so&#8217;s the
dint in his head fits the curb, see!&#8221;</p>

<p>They lifted him amongst them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady. Now over &#8217;ere a bit. That&#8217;s it. The curb just
about fits where the bloomin&#8217; lead hit his skull.... What a
lovely accident he looks to be sure!... Charlie,&#8221; he winked at
the others, &#8220;yer hit him harder than there was need for&mdash;he&#8217;s got
a hole in his thinking-box yer could put a good character into....
Steady. That&#8217;s it, leave him alone, can&#8217;t yer!... Now,
mates, shall we go and make ourselves conspicuous a-helpin&#8217; the
aristocracy to find their cabs&mdash;or shall we call the police?...
On the whole, I&#8217;m for helpin&#8217; the aristocracy. The police might
think the lady had led the gent down here&mdash;for reasons. Good-night,
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took off his hat with mock solemnity.</p>

<p>Charlie gave a warning whistle:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear a friend of mine coming down the road,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Scatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>They strode off into the darkness.</p>

<p>The girl stooped down and looked at the fallen man.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; said she, brushing tears from her eyes&mdash;&#8220;yes.
They might think I had&mdash;lured the poor fool&mdash;to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stepped into the fog and followed the sound of the retreating
footsteps up the street to the hurly-burly of the town.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCII</h3></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is seen that the Blood of the Oldest Families may run to
Inconsequence and Mere Vulgar Stains</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord Wyntwarde,</span> his face purple with anger and his mouth
uttering vile oaths that roused ugly echoes in the ruddy old
Elizabethan alleys, strode up and down the flagged walk of the
ancient cobbled courtyard before his stables; and the family
lawyer walked beside him anxiously, with &#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; and
&#8220;Listen to me&mdash;<i>one</i> moment,&#8221; and &#8220;Be reasonable, Lord Wyntwarde!&#8221;
whilst the wrathful lord, with much insistence of reiteration,
roundly wished him on a far and hot journey, being
free from all diffidence in naming the climate.</p>

<p>The coachman&#8217;s small children stood shrinking from the fury of
his lordship&#8217;s wrath, clinging to each other at the door of their
home, peeping coyly over timid little shoulders with large eyes of
awe at the cursing tyrant who strode before them. They were
dressed for travel&mdash;being tied up in large woollen mufflers that
seem to be the peculiar badge of the children of cottagers when
packed for a journey. Their tearful mother kept bringing down
hastily-made parcels and placing them about the door. In the
minds of the little ones, behind their wondering eyes, was the
picture of their father, the old coachman, sitting in the midst of
his dismantled home upstairs, crying like a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Wyntwarde,&#8221; said the lawyer, &#8220;you must pull yourself
together and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush&mdash;you must pull yourself together and listen to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go to the devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will not come indoors, then I must say it here, within
earshot of these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I stand over these hounds until they have packed
out of the place&mdash;do you hear me!&#8221; roared the stout old lord of
the place. &#8220;Damn it, Overshaw, do you only understand lawyers&#8217;
swindling English? God in heaven, is my talk too cursedly
effeminate for you that I must supply you with a glossary at the
end of it? I have sworn it, by the living God, that these people
leave my land before the sun sets&mdash;or,&#8221; he added hoarsely, &#8220;I
go to hell for it.... Put that into your damned attorney&#8217;s
gabble if you will&mdash;and I&#8217;ll sign it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>He turned about as he walked and continued his striding. The
lawyer turned and walked with him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Wyntwarde, I will not remind you of a wise old saying
that the sun should not go down upon our wrath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, damn your figurative landscapes,&#8221; said my lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not ask you to save yourself from an injustice&mdash;I am only
asking you to save yourself from an indignity&mdash;worse&mdash;from utter
shame&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have I to do with shame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What indeed, my lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re a wit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T ask you to give me ten minutes&#8217; close attention&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not give it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lawyer shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is flat.... Then I must say it now and here. Your
coachman yonder does not even suspect the truth. He has served
you loyally through rain and sunshine and cold and heat for
twenty and nine years. His loyalty blinds him to all but shame
for the master of his house&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The master of the house laughed roughly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Overshaw, go on&mdash;take sides with my grooms&mdash;go on.
By the splendour of God, a most wondrous coachman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he will know it within twenty-four hours after leaving
this place. God forgive me, he ought to know it now&mdash;from my
lips. My loyalty to your house brings me near to compounding
a felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, talk sense, Overshaw! What is the plain
English for all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen: your son Ponsonby has seduced this man&#8217;s daughter&mdash;which
is bad enough. But the girl is only fifteen&mdash;the which is
a felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lord burst into a storm of oaths:</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it, Overshaw; don&#8217;t I tell you I was for ever drumming
it into the lad&#8217;s ears that there were enough married women of his
own class in the county for any sane man&#8217;s pleasure&mdash;and he has
descended to my coachman&#8217;s wenches! It&#8217;s the filthy vulgarity
of the fellow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped&mdash;his bloodshot eyes catching the sneer upon the old
lawyer&#8217;s lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye say?&#8221; he bawled.</p>

<p>The lawyer put his hand on the arm of the other:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Wyntwarde, you do not understand&mdash;the girl is fifteen&mdash;this
is a common felony&mdash;if the young fellow does not marry the
girl, he may have to go to gaol&mdash;to the common gaol&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not his keeper&mdash;curse him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the old lawyer drily&mdash;&#8220;but do you want the
criminal law to usurp your duties?... There is a child coming.
Even if this youth put aside common honour, common justice, as
he has done before, it cannot now save him. All depends on how
you treat the girl&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>A groom, on a big bay hunter, came clattering into the courtyard,
started at the sight that met him there, leaped off his horse,
and walking up to the lawyer, touched his hat and held out a
yellow envelope:</p>

<p>&#8220;Telegram&mdash;for you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman&#8217;s hands shook as he tore open the cover.</p>

<p>He read it; and, as he read, his face went deathly pale:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>He glanced at the striding figure of the lord of this splendid
place, who paced up and down the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, my man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There is no answer....
Stay! keep that horse saddled&mdash;I may want you&mdash;and before
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The groom saluted and went and stood by the horse.</p>

<p>The lawyer gazed under his brows at the striding lord; watched
him take a couple of turns; went at last and set himself across
his path. The other halted when he came to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Wyntwarde,&#8221; said the old lawyer hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;I must
go back to town at once. Our arguments are at an end&mdash;the
reason for them is at an end.... Your son is beyond the reach
of penalty.&#8221; The old man took off his hat. &#8220;He must plead
before a more august judge than his own father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other, his face scarlet, stared at him with bloodshot eyes of
irritable inquiry. He struck his boot with his whip, savagely,
once, twice, thrice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;what&#8217;s the cursed melodrama now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your son has been found, early this morning. He has fallen&mdash;it
is thought&mdash;he was killed in a street brawl&mdash;last night&mdash;and
has lain where he fell till this morning. It is suspected that there
has been foul play.&#8221; The old lawyer&#8217;s chin dropped on his chest:
&#8220;God forgive the poor boy his many sins and weaknesses!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the old gentleman roused from his mood and put on his
hat, the red anger of his lord had slowly turned to black hate; and
the lawyer waited in a strange wonder&mdash;a wonder as to what could
be passing through this harsh old brain at such a moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The black mood found tongue at last:</p>

<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; said Lord Wyntwarde hoarsely, and struck the air
with his clenched hand, &#8220;Caroline and her cub get the estates
after all!&#8221; He laughed bitterly. &#8220;The devil has cheated me&mdash;Death
plays with loaded dice.... No, by God, I have it&#8221;&mdash;he
laughed loud&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll baulk them yet&mdash;I&#8217;ll marry this fifteen-year-old
she-dog myself. By the splendour of God, my coachman
shall give her ladyship away, and yonder groom shall be my best
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He burst into a loud roar of coarse laughter&mdash;suddenly gasped&mdash;struggled
for air&mdash;reeled&mdash;put out his hands as though blindness
had come upon him&mdash;uttered a foul curse, lurched forward, and
fell upon his face.</p>

<p>They lifted him up....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lord Wyntewarde&#8217;s life had been one long implied boast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
blood. Indeed, he had never realized that he had had too much.
The blood of the family had always gone to the head....</p>

<p>The grooms being fore-gathered in the harness-room that night
plumbed the deeps of the dead man:</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a noisy Bulgarian,&#8221; said one&mdash;&#8220;but he had a fine
seat on a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vicar of Cavil had long owed a grudge against the castle for
the evil things that therein were done, or said to be done&mdash;indeed,
it had caused much sly winking and nodding amongst the bucolic
wits. But, for his dignity&#8217;s sake and the sake of the soil that had
bred him, his sermon left the dead lord severely alone; however,
he improved the occasion of the young man&#8217;s death to point out
the evils that come of the pursuit of art by a youth who should
have been devoting himself to a gentleman&#8217;s life; and in particular
he laid it down that had this youth not been leaving the
immoral precincts of a London theatre on the night on which he
met his violent death, he would not have met that death.</p>

<p>Which, of a truth, was as it might have been.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein our Hero comes into a Wide Heritage</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sunny morning was well spent, but Noll was pacing restlessly
up and down his little bedroom at the hotel. His breakfast,
scarce tasted, lay on a tray at the foot of his bed. His design of
finding Betty before he discovered himself to his own people
threatened to be baulked; and defeat fretted his impatient will.
So he paced&mdash;leopard-like&mdash;when there came a tap at his door,
and the maid screamed through the panels that a gentleman
waited upon him below.</p>

<p>When Noll, descending the stairs, entered the dingy sitting-room
of the little hotel, an old gentleman rose to meet him; and
Noll found himself in the presence of the best and most loyal
friend his house knew, or was destined to know&mdash;the head of the
legal firm of Overshaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be Oliver Baddlesmere,&#8221; said the old lawyer&mdash;&#8220;you
are so like your mother;&#8221; and the courtesies passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the family lawyer,&#8221; said he simply. &#8220;Your mother told
me you were in Paris&mdash;but in Paris I was given your address at
Mr. Netherby Gomme&#8217;s here in town. I gathered therefore that
you had reasons for your family not knowing your address.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Noll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you have no engagements to-day, Mr. Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a serious business, but it must wait a day if you can
show me the reason for urgency,&#8221; said Noll. &#8220;For I am baffled,
and have found no clue. I am baffled in a search. I have lost
my wife,&#8221; he said simply&mdash;&#8220;and must find her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old eyes grew serious, then twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the first time I have heard a sentiment of duty from
a Ffolliott&mdash;from the head of your house,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;And
I am an old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll went and looked out of the window:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why drag in the Ffolliotts?&#8221; he asked wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother came into the title and estates three days ago,&#8221;
said the lawyer.</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>At last Noll said hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must find Betty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lawyer smiled inwardly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>Noll brooded for awhile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall suffocate in this dingy place,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Let us go out
to St. James&#8217;s Park&mdash;we can talk there in the fresh air&mdash;and I love
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked by Charing Cross and Pall Mall to St. James&#8217;s
Park, and thus, and amidst the laughter of children, Noll heard
that he had come near to the great responsibilities of his manhood.</p>

<p>The grassy place about him teemed with sweet associations of
Betty; and his mind kept straying away from the recital of his
fortune and the duties that had come to him to the rustle of sweet-scented
ghostly skirts that swept the grass and the fragrance of a
girl&#8217;s dainty being. And the old lawyer, shrewd man of the world,
suspected it, and was glad of it....</p>

<p>The old gentleman arose, and put his last questions:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, another point, before we part&mdash;your cousin wronged a
young girl&mdash;indeed, he wronged several&mdash;and deserted them.
What do you wish to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked keenly at the young fellow before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, as my mother will do, accept the burdens of my heritage
with the honours,&#8221; said the young fellow&mdash;&#8220;the debts with the
credit.&#8221; He smiled faintly. &#8220;I am afraid I am not a man of
fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish the girl provided for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only in common honour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wish I could
wholly blot out the damage. My&mdash;wife&mdash;would have had it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman put his hand on the young fellow&#8217;s shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oliver,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;you are bringing more to your house than
it is bringing to you.... Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCIV</h3></div>

<p class="center"><i>Wherein it is suspected that the Garden of Eden was Well Lost</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noll,</span> restless, his brain teeming with the things that had befallen
him this day, fretted with the baffling dilemma of finding Betty,
and alone with his conflicting moods, paced his little room until
long after the darkness came into it, when he roused, famished
but unhungry, flung out of the hotel, and turned aimlessly northwards,
pacing beside the sounding traffic into the darkness of the
night, that hung upon the more quiet ways where law students
have their dingy habitations.</p>

<p>He wandered towards the old quarters where he had strolled
the pavements gaily, a handsome youth, with a handsome girl by
his side&mdash;every flagstone was familiar to him&mdash;every dingiest
street-corner held a wan smile beneath its soot.</p>

<p>As he turned into the quaint old street where Betty had lodged,
he was startled to see her figure flitting in front of him.</p>

<p>He thought for a moment that he must be suffering from faintness&mdash;it
came to him that he had not broken his fast since morning.
But the sound of her well-known step, the light poise of her
lithe figure, left no doubt; and he cautiously followed her, hanging
back, afraid to startle her.</p>

<p>She turned of a sudden, with that forthright aimful intent that
directed all her acts; ran up some steps; set a key in the lock of
the door-latch; and, the door yawning open, she stepped into the
blackness and passed out of the night.</p>

<p>The thud of the slammed door came muffled on the night; and
Noll, striding out, crossed the street and arrived opposite the
house where he had spent many a happy tryst. It was the last
place in the world whither he would have expected Betty to go
into hiding&mdash;and he realized, with a whimsical smile, Betty&#8217;s keen
sense of humour and her shrewd capacity, in boldly deciding to
hide herself away in her old haunts.</p>

<p>The house was wholly in darkness. Not a soul was astir.</p>

<p>Noll brooded upon it....</p>

<p>At last came a light into a window.</p>

<p>Betty had mounted to her room.</p>

<p>It was the topmost attic of the house&mdash;where servants sleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly the singing at his heart ceased, Noll bent brooding
wits on the question as to what grinding toil kept Betty&#8217;s dainty
fingers at work at midnight to the winning of bread.</p>

<p>He crossed the road, walked up the steps, and rang the bell;
and, as he did so, a light came into the fan-shaped window over
the door where he stood.</p>

<p>There was a drawing of bolts, a key grated in the lock, and the
door swung open.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>Before him, lit by the candle that she held high above her head,
stood a pretty little woman, much overdressed above the extreme
height of the fashion with the curious picturesque exaggeration
that is the pretty habit of London theatrical folk&mdash;yet, for all her
charming attire, a daughter of the people. She was in her hat
still, as though not long come in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria May Alice!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She nodded pertly:</p>

<p>&#8220;God forgive me, that&#8217;s me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She shaded the light from her eyes with one hand, and stared
at the youth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, translate me to uttermost leading parts at the West
End Theatres if it ain&#8217;t Mister Noll!... You ain&#8217;t forgotten
Victoria May Alice, anyhow&mdash;there&#8217;s no error in <i>that</i> contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll stepped into the house, shut the door behind him with his
heel, and took her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria May Alice, I could almost kiss you,&#8221; said he, wringing
her fingers. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to know you are staying here&mdash;with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stayin&#8217;, Mr. Noll?... I own the whole bloomin&#8217; palace,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;When I&#8217;m not at the theatre I am running <i>this</i> show.
I go behind the scenes for sordid tragedy; and I listen to lodgers&#8217;
complaints for roaring comedy&mdash;see? And when you&#8217;ve done
that often enough, one week with another, you&#8217;ve eaten a pretty
thick slice of life, I can warn you.... But, you know, you ain&#8217;t
listenin&#8217; to a word I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed embarrassedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty is upstairs,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m&mdash;yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You know such a lot you&#8217;d
almost think you were her husband, Mr. Noll.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let the thrust pass him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;why does she work so late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;there&#8217;s a light in her room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria May Alice looked at him whimsically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you men are mostly only fit for comic
opera.... Well, if you want to know within an acre or two of
the truth, call again when the cats are coming home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Till daylight?&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;So help me Henery Irving,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;d see that
light burning still when the cockydoos are crowing in the lemon
of the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said Noll hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Put it on to God,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so like a
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, and added drily:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, of course, Mr. Noll, you don&#8217;t know.... How should
you? You&#8217;re her husband.... I think you&#8217;d better go up and
pull her nut-brown hair about the waste of candles, myself, eh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
What&#8217;s the good of being married to a woman if you can&#8217;t order
her about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll nodded, smiling sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must see her&mdash;at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along then,&#8221; said she, leading the way upstairs. She
put her fingers on her lips as sign for silence, and after that she
spoke never a word until she reached the topmost landing,
knocked at the attic door, flung it open; and, as Noll
stepped into the room, shut it again softly, and crept gently down
the stairs....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the snowy bed stood Betty in her white night-gown and
in her arms she held a little child, crooning to it a low-voiced
lullaby.</p>

<p>She looked up as the door opened:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll!&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll strode over to her, dumb with an overwhelming passion
for her, his heart leaping with a great surprise, walked as in a
dream, knelt down at her feet, put his arms about her limbs and
buried his face in the thin fabric of her nightdress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty,&#8221; he said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;why did you not tell me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to tell you&mdash;so many times, Noll&mdash;but&mdash;you would not
listen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah me,&#8221; said he, holding her close (how he loved the musical
voice!)&mdash;&#8220;I have been such a fool&mdash;such&mdash;a fool! But I have
found you, dear heart, at last&mdash;and in finding you I have found
all.&#8221; And he added: &#8220;I have suffered, Betty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her slender fingers upon his head.</p>

<p>He was shaken with a sob.</p>

<p>She stroked his hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have so longed for you, Noll&mdash;it has been very lonely. The
little one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll was sobbing like a child.</p>

<p>She bent down with the babe, lifted Noll&#8217;s face in her hand and
kissed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Noll, dear heart,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;you mustn&#8217;t do that.
This is no time for tears. We have come into our kingdom.&#8221;
She laughed with tears in the laugh. &#8220;And it is so near the
stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to be home,&#8221; he said. And he added with a sad
laugh: &#8220;It does not make me giddy being near the stars, sweetheart&mdash;I
have lived up there before&mdash;with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stroked his hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;she is fast asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led him to a small bed. She bent over it to turn down the
blankets and sheets and tucked the little one away, her red-brown
hair falling about the sleeping child.</p>

<p>He knelt down by the little white cot, a strange singing at his
heart, his limbs all a-tremble, and, putting out his hand, touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the tiny hand of the sleeping child, who opened small warm fingers
and clasped his thumb.</p>

<p>His eyes watched the little one hungrily.</p>

<p>Betty sat down sideways on the cot and gazed at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you think of her, Noll,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very beautiful,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Betty laughed gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think it, Noll; but she has her faults,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use disguising these things, you are bound to discover
them&mdash;she is self-willed, tyrannical, unscrupulous&mdash;ah,
how she tramples one&#8217;s heart under her woolly little shoes!&mdash;she
is greedy, frets under opposition, is ridiculously conceited about
her mother, I am afraid will be as arrogant about her father as he
is about himself, and altogether displays a lack of modesty and of
ladylike reserve that causes me the gravest anxiety about her
moral attributes.... You would never be able to disown her,
Noll&mdash;she has all your vices.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll smiled as the tears trickled down his face:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Betty,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;that a mother&#8217;s disparagements
are but veiled praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held her hand in his.</p>

<p>They sat so for a long while.</p>

<p>As he gazed down upon the little one, it came to him that his
mother had so looked down upon him, with a mighty hunger at her
heart&mdash;that his every pain had been a pain to her&mdash;his every smile
a smile in her heart. And what had he given in return? He felt
now the desolation it must have wrought in the silent mother&#8217;s
heart when he eagerly left the house and sallied forth to his cubhood,
unrealizing that his empty place echoed with the sound of a
dead child&#8217;s laughter and the merriment of the days of his innocence.</p>

<p>Would this little one so discard him&mdash;and Betty?</p>

<p>Thus, in this cradle was the beginning of that open confidence
between him and his mother that lit their love from that time.
The grandchild leads the wandering feet home again.</p>

<p>The tears welled into Noll&#8217;s eyes, and his lip trembled.</p>

<p>Betty stroked his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Noll&mdash;I have wanted you. That is enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
He bowed his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said Betty&mdash;&#8220;thou wilt be kind to her.... If she
lose me she has only you.&#8221; And she added after awhile: &#8220;The
child whose spirit is broken cannot be of the Masterfolk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll lifted her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>Betty bent forward and kissed him; she laughed happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll,&#8221; said she&mdash;&#8220;Eve did well when she flung away Paradise
to know the love of a little child.&#8221;</p>
